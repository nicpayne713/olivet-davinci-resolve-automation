00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I was alone, I couldn't find my place
'Til Heaven reached down, Your love it called my name
Out of my shame, out of the dead of night
Into a hope, into Your marvelous light

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
[Pre-Chorus]
It's Your mercy, I don't deserve Your mercy
That You would reach down for me and keep me as Your own
For Your glory, I'm living for Your glory
And I will tell the story of Your unfailing love
Be glorified, be lifted high
In all my life, be glorified

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Though I may run, though I may fall apart
Chasing this world, things that will break Your heart
But faithful and true, sure as the rising sun
One thing is true, one thing is sure to come

00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
[Pre-Chorus]
It's Your mercy, I don't deserve Your mercy
That You would reach down for me and keep me as Your own
For Your glory, I'm living for Your glory
And I will tell the story of Your unfailing love

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Be glorified, be lifted high
In all my life, be glorified
Be glorified, be lifted high
In all my life, be glorified
Be glorified
Be glorified

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, I've tasted and seen that You are good
And You're walking with me just like You said You would
And all that You say, every word is true
Oh, whom should I trust?
Jesus, I trust in You
Oh, I've tasted and seen that You are good
And You're walking with me just like You said You would
And all that You say, every word is true
Oh, whom should I trust?
Jesus, I trust in You
You might also like
You Canâ€™t Be Praised Enough
