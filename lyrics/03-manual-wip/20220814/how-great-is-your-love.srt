00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
From the darkness, I called Your name
Into darkness, Your mercy came
You called me out, lifted me up
How great is Your love

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You bore my weakness, You took my shame
Buried my burdens in fields of grace
You called me out, lifted me up
How great is Your love

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
From the heights of heaven, You stepped down to earth
Innocent perfection, gave Your life for us
We are amazed, we stand in awe
For we have been changed by the power of the cross

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
How great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love for us

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In Your kindness, You lead me home
In Your presence, where I belong
You called me out, lifted me up
How great is Your love

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From the heights of heaven, You stepped down to earth
Innocent perfection, gave Your life for us
And we are amazed, we stand in awe
For we have been changed by the power of the cross

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love for us
How great is Your love for us

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There has never been, there will never be
A God like You, a love so true
There has never been, and there will never be
A God like You, a love so true
There has never been, and there will never be
A God like You, a love so true
There has never been, no, there will never be
A God like You, a love so true!

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love for us
And how great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love
How great, how great, how great is Your love for us!
How great is Your love for us
