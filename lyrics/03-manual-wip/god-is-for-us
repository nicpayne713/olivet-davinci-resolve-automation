21
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:34,291
We won't fear the battle,
we won’t fear the night
We will walk the valley 
with You by our side

22
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:45,291
You will go before us,
You will lead the way
We have found a refuge,
only You can save

23
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:55,125
Sing with joy now: our God is for us
The Father's love is a 
strong and mighty fortress

24
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:05,333
Raise your voice now,
no love is greater
Who can stand against us 
if our God is for us

25
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:20,333
Even when I stumble,
even when I fall
Even when I turn back,
still Your love is sure

26
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:29,333
You will not abandon,
You will not forsake
You will cheer me onward 
with never-ending grace

27
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:38,666
Sing with joy now: our God is for us
The Father's love 
is a strong and mighty fortress

28
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:49,375
Raise your voice now,
no love is greater
Who can stand against us 
if our God is for us

29
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:15,375
Neither height nor depth can separate us
Hell and death will not defeat us
He who gave His son to free us
Holds me in His love

30
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:37,416
Neither height nor depth can separate us
Hell and death will not defeat us
He who gave His son to free us
Holds me in His love

31
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:48,016
Sing with joy now: our God is for us
The Father’s love is a 
strong and mighty fortress

32
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:57,458
Raise your voice now,
no love is greater
Who can stand against us 
if our God is for us

33
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:07,022
Sing with joy now: our God is for us
The Father's love is a
strong and mighty fortress

34
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:18,458
Raise your voice now,
no love is greater
Who can stand against us 
if our God is for us
