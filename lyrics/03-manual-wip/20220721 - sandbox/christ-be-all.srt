1
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:19,541
Oh to be, empty and lowly

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:26,583
Meek and unnoticed, and unknown

3
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:33,083
And to God, a vessel holy

4
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:40,083
Filled with Christ, and Christ alone

5
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:53,083
How great is God! His grandeur endless
How frail I come, before His throne

6
00:00:54,083 --> 00:01:08,125
I am lost, in love relentless
That Christ be all, and I His own

7
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:29,125
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak
May Christ be all, and I be nothing

8
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:45,166
This is my hope: Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope: Not I, but Christ in me

9
00:01:47,166 --> 00:02:00,166
I am poor, and I have nothing
All my deeds cannot avail

10
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:20,166
But Christ endured the Father's crushing
He bowed His head, as Mercy bled, 
peace to prevail
He bowed His head, as Mercy bled, 
peace to prevail

11
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:42,208
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak
May Christ be all, and I be nothing

12
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:59,208
This is my hope: Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope: Not I, but Christ in me

13
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:16,458
Bring me low, my heart lower still
That Your grace my pride relieves

14
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:31,250
May these words resound loud until
Every tribe and tongue believes

15
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:43,500
Bring me low, my heart lower still
That Your grace my pride relieves

16
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:56,958
May these words resound loud until
Every tribe and tongue can sing

17
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:11,250
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak

18
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:34,791
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
This is my hope: Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope: Not I, but Christ in me

19
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:50,833
On golden shores of sure salvation
I will run to meet my King

20
00:04:50,958 --> 00:05:12,333
Freed from shame and all accusation
He'll give Himself, nothing I'll bring
He'll give Himself, nothing I'll bring
