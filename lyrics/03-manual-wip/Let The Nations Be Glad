00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let the glory of the Lord forever be a joy
May redemption be the theme of our song
For by grace we have been saved
And by grace we shall proclaim
To the corners of the earth that Christ has come

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let the nations be glad, let the people rejoice
For salvation belongs to our God
Let the whole earth be filled with the praises of the Lord
For salvation belongs to our God
Let the nations be glad

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Through the ages gone before
Through the trial and the sword
Many saints and martyrs conquered though they died
Still we're holding out the cross
Crossing ocean suffering loss
Shall endure all things to win the crown of life

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let the nations be glad, let the people rejoice
For salvation belongs to our God
Let the whole earth be filled with the praises of the Lord
For salvation belongs to our God
Let the nations be glad

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
As your holy church goes forth, in the Holy Spiritâ€™s power
With the glories of the Gospel to explain
Now we pray Your kingdom come
And we pray Your will be done
For the honor and the glory of Your name

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let the nations be glad, let the people rejoice
For salvation belongs to our God
Let the whole earth be filled with the praises of the Lord
For salvation belongs to our God
Let the nations be glad
