00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

What is our hope in life and death
Christ alone Christ alone
What is our only confidence
That our souls to him belong

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who holds our days within his hand
What comes apart from his command
And what will keep us to the end
The love of Christ in which we stand

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O sing hallelujah
Our hope springs eternal
O sing hallelujah
Now and ever we confess
Christ our hope in life and death

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What truth can calm the troubled soul
God is good God is good
Where is his grace and goodness known
In our great Redeemer's blood

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who holds our faith when fears arise
Who stands above the stormy trial
Who sends the waves that bring us nigh
Unto the shore, the rock of Christ

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
O sing hallelujah
Our hope springs eternal
O sing hallelujah
Now and ever we confess
Christ our hope in life and death

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Unto the grave what shall we sing
Christ, he lives Christ, he lives
And what reward will heaven bring
Everlasting life with him

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There we will rise to meet the Lord
Then sin and death will be destroyed
And we will feast in endless joy
When Christ is ours forevermore

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O sing hallelujah
Our hope springs eternal
O sing hallelujah
Now and ever we confess
Christ our hope in life and death

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
O sing hallelujah
Our hope springs eternal
O sing hallelujah
Now and ever we confess
Christ our hope in life and death

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh now and ever we confess
Christ our hope in life and death
