00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

Oh Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the 
Worlds Thy hands have made

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout 
The universe displayed

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And when I think that God 
Is Son not sparing
Sent Him to die
I scarce can take it in

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That on the cross 
My burden gladly bearing
He bled and died 
TO take away my sin

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then Christ shall come 
With shouts of acclamation
And lead me home what joy 
Hall fill my heart

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Then I shall bow with 
Humble adoration
And then proclaim
My God how great Thou art

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
