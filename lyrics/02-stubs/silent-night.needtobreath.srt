00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant, so tender and mild

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sleep in Heavenly peace
Sleep in Heavenly peace

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing "Hallelujah"

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, oh, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
