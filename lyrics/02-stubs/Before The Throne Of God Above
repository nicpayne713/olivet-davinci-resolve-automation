1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great High Priest whose name is love
Who ever lives and pleads for me

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heavâ€™n He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No tongue can bid me thence depart

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Because the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To look on Him and pardon me

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Behold Him there, the risen Lamb
My perfect, spotless Righteousness
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
One with Himself, I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ my Savior and my God

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
With Christ my Savior and my God
