00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Crown Him with many crowns
The lamb upon the throne
Hark! How the heav'nly anthem drowns

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All music but its own
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for thee

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And hail Him as thy matchless king
Thru all eternity

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Crown Him the Son of God
Before the worlds began
And ye who tread where He hath trod

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Crown Him the Son of Man
Who every grief hath known
That wrings the human breast

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And takes and bears them for His own
That all in Him may rest

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Crown Him the Lord of Heaven
Enthroned in worlds above
Crown Him the King

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To Whom Is Given
The Wonderous Name of Love
Crown Him with many crowns

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As thrones before Him fall
Crown Him ye kings
With many crowns
For He is King of All
