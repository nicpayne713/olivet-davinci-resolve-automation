1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

God the Uncreated One
The author of salvation
Who wrote the laws of space and time
And fashioned worlds to His design

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The One whom angel hosts revere
Hung the stars like chandeliers
Numbered every grain of sand
Knows the heart of every man

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He is King forever
He is King forever
He is King forevermore

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
God our fortress and our strength
The rock on which we can depend
Matchless in His majesty
His power and authority

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Unshaken by the schemes of man
Never-changing, Great I Am
Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall
He is faithful through it all

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Crown Him King forever
Crown Him King forever
Crown Him King forevermore
Oh, forevermore

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Mighty God in mortal flesh
Forsaken by a traitor's kiss
The curse of sin and centuries
Did pierce the lowly Prince of Peace

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, lifted high, the sinless man
Crucified, the spotless Lamb
Buried by the sons of man
He was rescued by the Father's hand

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To reign as King forever
Reign as King forever
Reign as King forevermore

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
King Eternal, God of grace
We crown You with the highest praise
Heaven shouts and saints adore
You're holy, holy, holy Lord!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What joy in everlasting life
All is love and faith is sight
Justice rolls and praises rise
At the name of Jesus Christ

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
King of kings forever
King of kings forever
King of kings forevermore

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He is King of kings forever
King of kings forever
King of kings forevermore
Oh, forevermore
