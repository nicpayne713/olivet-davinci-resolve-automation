00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Amazing love
That welcomes me
The kindness of mercy

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That bought with blood
wholeheartedly
My soul undeserving

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Behold the cross
Age to age
And hour by hour

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The dead are raised
the sinner saved
The work of Your power

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
God, You're so good
God, You're so good

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I am blessed, I am called
I am healed, I am whole
I am saved in Jesus' name

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Highly favored, anointed
Filled with Your power
For the glory of Jesus' name

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I am blessed, I am called
I am healed, I am whole
I am saved in Jesus' name

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Highly favored, anointed
Filled with Your power
For the glory of Jesus' name

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And should this life
Bring suffering
Lord, I will remember

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What Calvary has bought for me
Both now and forever
And forever

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000

I am saved in Jesus' name

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Highly favored, anointed
Filled with Your power
For the glory of Jesus' name

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
