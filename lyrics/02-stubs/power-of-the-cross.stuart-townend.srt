1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, to see the dawn 
of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tried by sinful men
torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, to see the pain 
written on Your face
Bearing the awesome 
weight of sin

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ev'ry bitter thought
ev'ry evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now the daylight flees
now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Curtain torn in two
dead are raised to life
Finished the vict'ry cry

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, to see my name
written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Death is crushed to death
life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, to see my name
written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Death is crushed to death
life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This, the power of the cross
Son of God, slain for us
What a love, what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This, the power of the cross
Son of God, slain for us
What a love, what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross
