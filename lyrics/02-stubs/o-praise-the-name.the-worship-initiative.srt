00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

I cast my mind to Calvary
Where Jesus bled and died for me
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
My Savior on that cursed tree

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
His body bound and drenched in tears
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
The entrance sealed by heavy stone
Messiah still and all alone

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O praise the Name of the Lord our God
O praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then on the third at break of dawn
The Son of heaven rose again
O trampled death, where is your sting
The angels roar for Christ the King!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
O praise the Name of the Lord our God
O praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God!

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He shall return in robes of white
The blazing sun shall pierce the night
And I will rise among the saints
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O praise the Name of the Lord our God
O praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O praise the Name of the Lord our God
O praise His Name forevermore!
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O praise the Name of the Lord our God
O praise His Name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God!
