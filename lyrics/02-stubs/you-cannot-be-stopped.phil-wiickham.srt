1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

The dark tried to hide You
And steal You away

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Death tried to keep You
Inside of the grave

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The enemy fought You
He tried but he lost

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You cannot be stopped

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When we cried for freedom
You tore down the walls

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The weight of our burdens
You carried it all

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Our fears and our failures
Hang dead on the cross

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You cannot be stopped

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mover of mountains
Breaker of chains
Jesus has triumphed 
over the grave

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sing hallelujah
The battle is won
Nothing can stand 
against our God

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We stand on Your victory
And shout out Your praise

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Miracle maker
You're mighty to save

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Awesome in power
Relentless in love

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You cannot be stopped

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Mover of mountains
Breaker of chains
Jesus has triumphed
over the grave

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Sing hallelujah
The battle is won
Nothing can stand 
against our God

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There's nothing 
that can stop our God

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There is nothing 
There is nothing

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There's nothing 
that can stop our God

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There is nothing 
There is nothing

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There's nothing 
that can stop our God

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There is nothing

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mover of mountains
Breaker of chains
Jesus has triumphed 
over the grave

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sing hallelujah
The battle is won
Nothing can stand 
against our God

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sing hallelujah
The battle is won
Nothing can stand 
against our God
