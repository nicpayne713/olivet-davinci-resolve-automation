00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

Oh come, oh come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, oh Israel

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, oh Israel

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, oh Israel

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny
From depths of hell Thy people save
And give them vict'ry over the grave

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, oh Israel

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, oh Israel
