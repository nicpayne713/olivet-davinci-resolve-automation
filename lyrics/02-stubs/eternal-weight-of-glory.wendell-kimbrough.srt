00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now the days and hours and moments
Of our suff'ring seem so long
And the toilsome wait and wond'ring
Threaten silence to our song

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now our pain is real and pressing
Where our faith is thin and weak
But our hope is set on Jesus
And we cling to him, our strength

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh eternal weight of glory!
Oh inheritance divine!
We will see our Lord redeeming
Every past and future time

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All our pains will be transfigured
Like the scars of Christ our Lord
We will see the weight of glory
And our broken years restored

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For behold! I tell a myst'ry
At the trumpet sound we'll wake
Death is swallowed up in vict'ry!
When we meet our King of Grace

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Every year we thought was wasted
Every night we cried "How long?"
All will be a passing moment
In our Savior's vict'ry song

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We will see our wounded Savior
We'll behold him face to face
And we'll hear our anguished stories
Sung as vict'ry songs of grace

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For behold! I tell a myst'ry
At the trumpet sound we'll wake
Death is swallowed up in vict'ry!
When we meet our King of Grace

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Every year we thought was wasted
Every night we cried "How long?"
All will be a passing moment
In our Savior's vict'ry song

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Every year we thought was wasted
Every night we cried "How long?"
All will be a passing moment
In our Savior's vict'ry song
