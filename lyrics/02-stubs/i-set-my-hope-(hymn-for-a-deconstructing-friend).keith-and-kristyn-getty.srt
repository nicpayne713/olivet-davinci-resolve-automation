00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When this life of trials
test my faith
I set my hope on Jesus

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When the questions come
and doubts remain
I set my hope on Jesus

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For the deepest wounds
that time won't heal
There's a joy that
runs still deeper

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's a truth that's more
than all I feel
I set my hope on Jesus

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Though I falter in this
war with sin
I set my hope on Jesus

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When I fail the fight 
and sink within
I set my hope on Jesus

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though the shame would 
drown me in its sea
And I dread the waves of justice

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will cast my life on Calvary
I set my hope on Jesus

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Though the world called me 
to leave my Lord
I set my hope on Jesus

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Though it offer all its 
vain rewards
I set my hope on Jesus

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Though this heart of mine 
is prone to stray
Give me grace enough to finish

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
'Til I worship on that final day
I set my hope on Jesus

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus
I set my hope on Jesus
