00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For what we have done
and left undone
We fall on Your countless mercies

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For sins that are known
and those unknown
We call on Your name so holy

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For envy and pride
for closing our eyes
For scorning our very neighbor

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In thought word and deed
we've failed You our King
How deeply we need a Savior

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For what You have done 
Your life of love
You perfectly lived we praise You

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though tempted and tried
You fixed Your eyes
You finished the work God gave You

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And there on the tree
a King among thieves
You bled for a world's betrayal

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You loved to the end
our merciful friend
How pure and forever faithful

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
For hearts that are cold
for seizing control
For scorning our very Maker

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In thought word and deed
we've failed You our King
How deeply we need a Savior

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
