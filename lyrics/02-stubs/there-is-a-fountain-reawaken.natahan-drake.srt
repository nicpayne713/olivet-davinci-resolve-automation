00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There is a fountain 
Filled with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And sinners plunged 
Beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And sinners plunged 
Beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And there have I though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And there have I though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Dear dying Lamb 
Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Be saved to sin no more
Be saved to sin no more

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
E’er since by faith 
I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
