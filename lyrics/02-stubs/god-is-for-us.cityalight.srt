00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

        We won't fear the battle
we wonâ€™t fear the night
We will walk the valley 
with You by our side

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You will go before us
You will lead the way
We have found a refuge
only You can save

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sing with joy now
our God is for us
The Father's love 
is a strong and mighty fortress

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Raise your voice now
no love is greater
Who can stand against us
if our God is for us

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Even when I stumble
even when I fall
Even when I turn back
still Your love is sure

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You will not abandon
You will not forsake
You will cheer me onward
with never-ending grace

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sing with joy now
our God is for us
The Father's love
is a strong and mighty fortress

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Raise your voice now
no love is greater
Who can stand against us
if our God is for us

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Neither height nor depth
can separate us
Hell and death
will not defeat us

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He who gave
His son to free us
Holds me in His love

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Neither height nor depth
can separate us
Hell and death
will not defeat us

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He who gave
His son to free us
Holds me in His love

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sing with joy now
our God is for us
The Father's love
is a strong and mighty fortress

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Raise your voice now
no love is greater
Who can stand against us
if our God is for us

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sing with joy now
our God is for us
The Father's love
is a strong and mighty fortress

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Raise your voice now
no love is greater
Who can stand against us
if our God is for us
