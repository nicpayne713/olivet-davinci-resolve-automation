1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All sufficient merit 
Shining like the sun
A fortune I inherit 
By no work I have done

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My righteousness I forfeit 
At my Savior's cross
Where all sufficient merit 
Did what I could not

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In love He condescended 
Eternal now in time
A life without a blemish 
The Maker made to die

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The law could never save us
Our lawlessness had won
Until the pure and spotless 
Lamb had finally come

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It is done, it is finished
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I lay down my garments
Any empty boasts
Good works all corrupted 
By the sinful host

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm dressed in my Lord Jesus
A crimson robe made white
No more fear of judgement
His righteousness is mine

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It is done, it is finished
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It is done, it is finished
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All sufficient merit
Firm in life and death
The joy of my salvation 
Shall be my final breath

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And when I stand accepted 
Before the throne of God
I'll gaze upon my Jesus 
And thank Him for the cross

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes I'll thank You for the cross

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It is done, it is finishe
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It is done, it is finished
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your Merit now my own
Your Merit now my own
