00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in His day
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its pow'r
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When this poor, lisping, 
stamm'ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave
Then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
Then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
