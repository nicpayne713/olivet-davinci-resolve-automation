1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

You brought me from darkness
And clothed me in garments of praise
Jesus, forever
My song will be You

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm living in freedom
You've taken my burdens away
Jesus, forever
My song will be You

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Only for You

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For the cross that You bore 
And the debt that You paid
For the victory 
You won over death and the grave

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is the reason I sing

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For the hope that You give 
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that 
Heaven is waiting for me

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is the reason I sing

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will not be silent
I'll testify of Your grace
Jesus, forever
My song will be You

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Only for You

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For the cross that You bore 
And the debt that You paid
For the victory 
You won over death and the grave
This is the reason I sing

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For the hope that You give 
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that 
Heaven is waiting for me

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is the reason I sing

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So good so good
You're so good to me

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Forever 
I'll sing
You're so good to me

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So good so good
You're so good to me

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Forever I'll sing
You're so good to me

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For the cross that You bore 
And the debt that You paid
For the victory 
You won over death and the grave

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, this is the reason I sing

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
For the hope that You give 
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that 
Heaven is waiting for me

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is the reason I sing

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
For the cross that You bore 
And the debt that You paid
For the victory 
You won over death and the grave

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is the reason I sing

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
For the hope that You give 
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that 
Heaven is waiting for me

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, this is the reason I sing

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Jesus, the reason I sing
Jesus, the reason I sing
Jesus, the reason I sing
