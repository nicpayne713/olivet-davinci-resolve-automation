00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The sun comes up
It's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Whatever may pass 
And whatever lies before me
Let me be singing 
When the evening comes

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're rich in love 
And You're slow to anger
Your name is great 
And Your heart is kind

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons 
For my heart to find

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And on that day 
When my strength is failing
The end draws near 
And my time has come

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Still my soul will sing 
Your praise unending

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Ten thousand years 
And then forevermore
Forevermore

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes I will worship Your holy name
Lord, I'll worship Your holy name

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name
I will worship Your holy name
Worship Your holy name
