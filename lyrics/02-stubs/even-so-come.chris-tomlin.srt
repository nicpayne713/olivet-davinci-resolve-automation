All of creation
All of the earth
Make straight a highway
A path for the Lord

Call back the sinner
Wake up the saint
Let every nation shout of Your fame

We'll be at Church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Even so come
Lord Jesus, come

There will be justice
all will be new
Your name forever
faithful and true

So we wait
We wait for You
