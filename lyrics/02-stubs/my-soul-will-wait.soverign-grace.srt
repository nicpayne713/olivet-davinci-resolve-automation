00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When the enemy surrounds
And my heart grows faint within
When the darkness overwhelms
And my fears are pressing in

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I will trust in You
Oh, Lord
In the silence I will wait
I will stand upon Your word

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're my solid rock
And my salvation
My steadfast hope
That won't be shaken

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're my stronghold and my shield
In the midst of every threat
Though the wicked never yield
They will vanish like a breath

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes I know the outcome's sure
Satan's evil plans will fail
In Your power I'm secure

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're my solid rock
And my salvation
My steadfast hope
That won't be shaken

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're my comfort
When I feel forsaken
My refuge and
My sure foundation

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is love I can't explain
This is mercy unreserved
Through Your sacrifice so great
I have peace that's undeserved

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For the battle has been won
And I fear no shame or loss
Now the sting of death is gone

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You're my solid rock
And my salvation
My steadfast hope
That won't be shaken

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're my comfort
When I feel forsaken
My refuge and
My sure foundation

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Pouring out our 
Hearts before You
We will trust in You

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Perfect Savior
Strong defender
We will trust in You
