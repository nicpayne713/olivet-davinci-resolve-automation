00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner condemned unclean

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How marvelous How wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous How wonderful
Is my Savior’s love for me

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For me it was in the garden
He prayed: Not my will but Thine
He had no tears for His own griefs
But sweat-drops of blood for mine

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In pity angels beheld Him
And came from the world of light
To strengthen Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv’ry
And suffered and died alone

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me
