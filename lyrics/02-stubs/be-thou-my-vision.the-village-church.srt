00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Be thou my vision
O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me
Save that thou art

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thou my best thought 
By day or by night
Waking or sleeping
Thy presence my light

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Be thou my wisdom
And thou my true word
I ever with thee and 
Thou with me, Lord

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thou my great father
I thy true son
Thou in me dwelling 
And I with thee one

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Be thou my battle shield
Sword for my fight
Be thou my dignity
Thou my delight

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thou my soul's shelter
Thou my high tower
Raise me thou heavenward
Oh pow'r of my pow'r

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Riches thy heed not
Nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheiritance
Now and always

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thou and thou only
First in my heart
High king of heaven
My treasure thou art

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thou and thou only
First in my heart
High king of heaven
My treasure thou art
