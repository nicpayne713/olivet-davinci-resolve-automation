00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Light of the world
Treasure of Heaven
Brilliant like the stars
In the wintery sky

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Joy of the Father
Reach through the darkness
Shine across the Earth
Send the shadows to flight

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Light of the world
From the beginning
The tragedies of time
Were no match for Your love

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From great heights of glory
You saw my story
God, You entered in
And became one of us

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
For the things He has done

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come and adore Him
Bow down before Him
Sing hallelujah
To the light of the world

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Light of the world
Crown in a manger
Born for the cross
To suffer, to save

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
High King of Heaven
Death is the poorer
We are the richer
By the price that He paid

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
For the things He has done

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come and adore Him
Bow down before Him
Sing hallelujah
To the light of the world

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're the light of the world

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Light up the dark

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Light of the world
Soon will be coming
With fire in His eyes
He will ransom His own

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Through clouds He will lead us
Straight into glory
And there He shall reign forevermore
Forevermore

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
For the things He has done

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come and adore Him
Bow down before Him
And sing hallelujah
To the light of the world
The light of the world
