1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Go on up to the mountain of mercy
To the crimson perpetual tide

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Kneel down on the shore
be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Follow Christ to the holy mountain
Sinner sorry and wrecked 
by the fall

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Cleanse your heart and soul 
in the fountain that flows
For you for me and for all

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
At the wonderful tragic 
mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous 
night you and me

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Were atoned by His blood 
and forever washed white
On a beautiful scandalous night

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
On the hillside 
you will be delivered
At the foot of the cross justified

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And your spirit restored 
by the river that pours
From our blessed Savior's side

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
At the wonderful tragic 
mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous 
night you and me

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Were atoned by His blood 
and forever washed white
On a beautiful scandalous night

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
At the wonderful tragic 
mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous 
night you and me

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Were atoned by His blood 
and forever washed white
On a beautiful scandalous night

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah yeah oh oh

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Go on up to the mountain of mercy
To the crimson perpetual tide

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Kneel down on the shore 
be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
At the wonderful tragic 
mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous 
night you and me

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Were atoned by His blood 
and forever washed white
On a beautiful scandalous night

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
On a beautiful scandalous night
On a beautiful scandalous night
