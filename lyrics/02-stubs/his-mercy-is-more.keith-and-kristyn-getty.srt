00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What love could remember 
no wrongs we have done
Omniscient, all knowing
He counts not their sum

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thrown into a sea 
without bottom or shore
Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

Praise the Lord
His mercy is more

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Stronger than darkness
new every morn
Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What patience would wait 
as we constantly roam
What Father, so tender
is calling us home

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He welcomes the weakest
the vilest, the poor
Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

Praise the Lord
His mercy is more

new every morn
Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What riches of kindness 
He lavished on us
His blood was the payment
His life was the cost

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We stood 'neath a debt 
we could never afford
Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Praise the Lord
His mercy is more
