Early in the morning
Our song shall rise to Thee

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Casting down their golden crowns
Around the glassy sea

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Cherubim and Seraphim
Falling down before Thee

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Which wert and art
And evermore shalt be

Thy glory may not see

Only Thou art holy
There is none beside Thee

00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Perfect in power
In love and purity

In earth and sky and sea
