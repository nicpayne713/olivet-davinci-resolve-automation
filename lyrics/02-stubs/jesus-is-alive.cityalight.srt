00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There is now a hope 
That lasts beyond our days
For the One that once 
Was buried lives again

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now the tomb is bare and empty
And the stone is rolled away
Praise the Risen One 
Who overcame the grave

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All you broken hearted
All you worn and weak
Come find living water
Everlasting streams

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
To the wandering spirit 
Lost and searching
Wanting something more

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Find the Risen King 
Who overcomes the world

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let there be dancing 
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No more condemnation
No more doubt and fear
For our sin and shame
They have no power here

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In His resurrection perfect love 
Has set the captives free
Praise the Risen King 
Who stands in victory

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let there be dancing 
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let there be dancing
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hallelujah
Death is undone
Hallelujah
Jesus has won

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hallelujah
We overcome
Oh in Jesus
Oh in Jesus

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hallelujah
Death is undone
Hallelujah
Jesus has won

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hallelujah
We overcome
Oh in Jesus
Oh in Jesus

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hallelujah
Death is undone
Hallelujah
Jesus has won

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hallelujah
We overcome
Oh in Jesus
Oh in Jesus

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let there be dancing 
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let there be dancing 
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive
