00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Amazing love
That welcomes me
The kindness of mercy

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That bought with blood
Wholeheartedly
My soul undeserving

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Behold the cross
Age to age
And hour by hour

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The dead are raised
The sinner saved
The work of Your power

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I am blessed, I am called
I am healed, I am whole
I am saved in Jesus' name

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Highly favored, anointed
Filled with Your power
For the glory of Jesus' name

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And should this life
Bring suffering
Lord, I will remember

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What Calvary 
Has bought for me
Both now and forever

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I am blessed, I am called
I am healed, I am whole
I am saved in Jesus' name

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Highly favored, anointed
Filled with Your power
For the glory of Jesus' name

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me
