1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

We are a sea of voices
We are an ocean of your praise
Gathered under one name

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We are a tide that's rising
And we cannot be contained
Gathered under one name

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord
God Almighty

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
You are worthy God

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We have found our anthem
At the cross where sin was slain
Gathered under one name

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Where every chain is broken
Every sorrow swept away
Gathered under one name

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord
God Almighty

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
You are worthy God

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
With all heaven sing
And all earth below
One holy King
One highest throne

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With all heaven sing
And all earth below
One holy King
One highest throne

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord
God Almighty

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
Yes, You are so worthy God

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord
God Almighty

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
You are worthy God

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000

Yes, You are so worthy God
