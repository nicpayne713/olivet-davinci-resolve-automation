1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

        Lord, from the depths 
I call to You
Lord, hear me from on high

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And give attention 
to my voice
When I for mercy cry

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Out of the depths I cry to You
In darkest places I will call
Incline Your ear to me anew
And hear my cry for mercy, Lord

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Were You to count my sinful ways
How could I come before Your throne
Yet full forgiveness meets my gaze
I stand redeemed by grace alone

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I will wait for You
I will wait for You
On Your word, I will rely

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will wait for You
Surely wait for You
Till my soul is satisfied

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So put your hope in God alone
Take courage in His power to save
Completely and forever won
By Christ emerging from the grave

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will wait for You
I will wait for You
On Your word, I will rely

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will wait for You
Surely wait for You
Till my soul is satisfied

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now He has come to make a way
And God Himself has paid the price
That all who trust in Him today
Find healing in His sacrifice

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will wait for You
I will wait for You
On Your word, I will rely

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will wait for You
Surely wait for You
Till my soul is satisfied

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will wait for You
I will wait for You
Through the storm and through the night

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I will wait for You
Surely wait for You
For Your love is my delight

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I pray my soul waits for the Lord
My hope is in His word
More than the watchman waits for dawn
My soul waits for the Lord
