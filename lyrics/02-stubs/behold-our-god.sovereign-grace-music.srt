00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who has held the oceans in his hands?
Who has numbered every grain of sand?
Kings and nations tremble at his voice
All creation rises to rejoice

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Behold our God
seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who has given counsel to the Lord?
Who can question any of his words?
Who can teach, the one who knows all things?
Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Behold our God

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who has felt the nails upon his hands?
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man
God eternal, humbled to the grave
Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Behold our God
seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Behold our king
nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him
