00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who has held the 
Oceans in his hands?
Who has numbered 
Every grain of sand?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Kings and nations 
Tremble at his voice
All creation rises to rejoice

00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Behold our God
Seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Who has given 
Counsel to the Lord?
Who can question 
Any of his words?

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Who can teach
The one who knows all things?
Who can fathom 
All his wondrous deeds?

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Behold our God
Seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who has felt the 
Nails upon his hands?
Bearing all the 
Guilt of sinful man

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
God eternal 
Humbled to the grave
Jesus, Savior
Risen now to reign

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Behold our God
Seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Behold our king
Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him
