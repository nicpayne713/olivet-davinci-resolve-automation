00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There’s peace that outlasts darkness
Hope thats in the blood
There’s future grace thats mine today
That Jesus Christ has won

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I can face tomorrow
For tomorrow’s in Your hands
All I need you will provide
Just like you always have

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I’m fighting a battle
That you’ve already won
No matter what comes my way
I will overcome

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don’t know what you're doing
But I know what you’ve done
I’m fighting a battle that
You’ve already won

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There’s mercy in the waiting
Mana for today
And when it’s gone I know you’re not
You are my hope and stay

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When the sea is raging
Your Spirit is my help
He’ll fix my eyes on Jesus Christ
And I’ll say that is well
Oh I know that it is well

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I’m fighting a battle
That you’ve already won
No matter what comes my way
I will overcome

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don’t know what you're doing
But I know what you’ve done
I’m fighting a battle that
You’ve already won

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I know how the story ends
We will be with you again
You’re my Savior my defense
No More fear in life or death

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I know how the story ends
We will be with you again
You’re my Savior my defense
No More fear in life or death

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I know how the story ends
We will be with you again
You’re my Savior my defense
No More fear in life or death
I know how this story ends

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I’m fighting a battle
That you’ve already won
No matter what comes my way
I will overcome

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don’t know what you're doing
But I know what you’ve done
I’m fighting a battle that
You’ve already won

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I’m fighting a battle
You’ve already won
