00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come behold the wondrous mystery
In the dawning of the king
He the theme of Heaven's praises
Robed in frail humanity

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In our longing in our darkness
Now the light of life has come
Look to Christ who condescended
Took on flesh to ransom us

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Come behold the wondrous mystery
He is the perfect son of man
In His living in His suffering
Never trace nor stain of sin

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
See the true and better Adam
Come to save the hell-bound man
Christ the great 
and sure fulfilment
Of the law in Him we stand

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Come behold the wondrous mystery
Christ the Lord upon the tree
In the stead of ruined sinners
Hangs the lamb in victory

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
See the price of our redemption
See the Father's plan unfold
Bringing many sons to glory
Grace unmeasured love untold

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come behold the wondrous mystery
Slain by death the God of life
But no grave could 
ever restrain Him
Praise the Lord He is alive

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What a foretaste of deliverance
How unwavering our hope
Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when He comes

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What a foretaste of deliverance
How unwavering our hope
Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when He comes

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What a foretaste of deliverance
How unwavering our hope
Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when He comes
