1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

        The cup was not removed
He drank it all
See Him hanging there 
where I belong

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
His tears were as scarlet
But there in the garden
The cup was not removed

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
O praise the Lamb 
who takes away my sin
He tore the veil
now I can enter in

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The law was not removed
it was fulfilled
The prayers of all 
the prophets now revealed

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In the image of the Father
The yes of every promise
The law was not removed

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
O praise the Lamb 
who takes away my sin
He tore the veil
now I can enter in

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
O praise the One 
with scars in His hands
O praise the Son 
who died and rose again

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My sins are now removed
yes every one
Taken by my Jesus 
on the cross

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As far as east and west
I see His righteousness

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My sins are now removed
My sins are now removed
O praise Him, O praise Him

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
O praise the Lamb 
who takes away my sin
He tore the veil
now I can enter in

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
O praise the One 
with scars in His hands
O praise the Son 
who died and rose again

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For all my days 
my soul will praise Him
For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The cup was not removed
He drank it all
See Him hanging there where I belong

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O praise the Lamb 
who takes away my sin
He tore the veil
now I can enter in

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
For all my days 
my soul will praise Him
