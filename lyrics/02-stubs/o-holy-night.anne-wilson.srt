00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night 
Of our dear Savior's birth

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Long lay the world 
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared 
And the soul felt its worth

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks 
A new and glorious morn

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night, when Christ was born

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh night divine
Oh nigh 
Oh night divine

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Truly, He taught us 
To love one another
His law is love 
And His gospel is peace

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cеase

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sweet hymns of joy 
In grateful chorus raise wе
Let all within us 
Praise His holy name

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christ is the Lord
Oh praise His name forever
His power and glory 
Evermore proclaim

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh night divine
Oh night
Oh night divine

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night, when Christ was born

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh night divine
Oh night
Oh night divine
