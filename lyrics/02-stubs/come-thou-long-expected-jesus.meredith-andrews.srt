1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come, thou long expected Jesus
Born to set thy people free
From our fears and sins release us
Let us find our rest in thee

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Israel's strength and consolation
Hope of all the earth thou art
Dear desire of every nation
Joy of every longing heart

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Joy of every heart

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Born thy people to deliver
Born a child and yet a King
Born to reign in us forever
Now thy gracious kingdom bring

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By thine own eternal spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone
By thine all sufficient merit
Raise us to thy glorious throne

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
oh oh oh oh oh

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You draw the hearts of shepherds
You draw the hearts of kings
Even as a baby
You were changing everything

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You called me to Your Kingdom
Before Your lips could speak
And even as a baby
You were reaching out for me

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And now we are awaiting
The day of Your return
When every eye will see You
As heaven comes to earth

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Until the sky is opened
Until the trumpet sounds
The bride is getting ready
The church is singing out

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Come, thou long expected Jesus
Born to set thy people free
From our fears and sins release us
Let us find our rest in thee

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come, thou long expected King
