00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

        I was alone
I couldn't find my place
'Til Heaven reached down 
Your love it called my name

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Out of my shame
Out of the dead of night
Into a hope
into Your marvelous light

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's Your mercy
I don't deserve Your mercy
That You would reach down for me 
and keep me as Your own

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For Your glory
I'm living for Your glory
And I will tell the story 
of Your unfailing love

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Be glorified
Be lifted high
In all my life
Be glorified

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Though I may run
Though I may fall apart
Chasing this world
Things that will break Your heart

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But faithful and true
Sure as the rising sun
One thing is true
One thing is sure to come

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's Your mercy
I don't deserve Your mercy
That You would reach down for me 
And keep me as Your own

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For Your glory
I'm living for Your glory
And I will tell the story 
of Your unfailing love

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Be glorified
be lifted high
In all my life
be glorified

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Be glorified
be lifted high
In all my life
be glorified

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Be glorified

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Be glorified

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, I've tasted and seen 
that You are good
And You're walking with me
just like You said You would

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And all that You say
every word is true
Oh, whom should I trust?
Jesus, I trust in You

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, I've tasted and seen
that You are good
And You're walking with me 
just like You said You would

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And all that You say
every word is true
Oh, whom should I trust?
Jesus, I trust in You

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Be glorified
be lifted high
In all my life
be glorified

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Be glorified
be lifted high
In all my life
be glorified

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Be glorified

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's Your mercy
I don't deserve Your mercy
That You would reach down for 
me and keep me as Your own

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
For Your glory
I'm living for Your glory
And I will tell the story 
of Your unfailing love

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Your unfailing love
