1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When the music fades
And all is stripped away
And I simply come

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless your heart

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm coming back to the 
Heart of worship
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry Lord for 
The thing I've made it
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is yours
Every single breath

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm coming back to the 
Heart of worship
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry Lord for the 
Thing I've made it
It's all about you
It's all about you Lord

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm coming back to the 
Heart of worship
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry Lord for the 
Thing I've made it
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll bring you more than a song
More than a song

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
By your grace, God
I'll bring you more than a song
More than a song

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
By your grace, God
I'll bring you more than a song
More than a song

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000


20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
