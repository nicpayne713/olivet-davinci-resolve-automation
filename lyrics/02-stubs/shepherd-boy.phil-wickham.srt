00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This kind of thing shouldn't happen to me
I'm just a boy who watches the sheep
But I saw a miracle

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A star like the morning lit up the night
A choir of angels filled up the sky
They sang of a miracle

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Glory to God in the highest
Peace to His people here on earth
For the Savior is born

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Emmanuel God is with us
And He will reign forevermore
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I ran to that town to see if it's true
Is He really here Had Heaven come through
And oh it was beautiful

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cause there in the stable asleep in her arms
The Lion of Judah the King of my heart
With tears filling up my eyes
Of this I will testify

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Glory to God in the highest
Peace to His people here on earth
For the Savior is born

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Emmanuel God is with us
And He will reign forevermore
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He brings joy to the world
Joy to the world
He brings joy to the world
He brings joy to the world

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Glory to God in the highest
Peace to His people here on earth
For the Savior is born

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Emmanuel God is with us
And He will reign forevermore
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords
