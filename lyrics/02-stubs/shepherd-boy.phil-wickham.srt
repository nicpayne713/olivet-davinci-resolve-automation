1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This kind of thing
shouldn't happen to me
I'm just a boy
who watches the sheep

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I saw a miracle

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A star like the morning 
lit up the night
A choir of angels
filled up the sky

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They sang of a miracle

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Glory to God in the highest
Peace to His people here on earth
For the Savior is born

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Emmanuel God is with us
And He will reign forevermore
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So I ran to that town
to see if it's true
Is He really here
Had Heaven come through

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And oh it was beautiful

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cause there in the
stable asleep in her arms
The Lion of Judah
the King of my heart

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With tears filling up my eyes
Of this I will testify

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Glory to God in the highest
Peace to His people here on earth
For the Savior is born

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Emmanuel God is with us
And He will reign forevermore
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He brings joy to the world
Joy to the world
He brings joy to the world
He brings joy to the world

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Glory to God in the highest
Peace to His people here on earth
For the Savior is born

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Emmanuel God is with us
And He will reign forevermore
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Jesus Christ the Lord of Lords
