00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What gift of grace 
Is Jesus my redeemer
There is no more 
For heaven now to give

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He is my joy
My righteousness, and freedom
My steadfast love
My deep and boundless peace

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To this I hold
My hope is only Jesus
For my life is wholly bound to His

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh how strange and divine
I can sing, "All is mine"
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The night is dark 
But I am not forsaken
For by my side
The Saviour He will stay

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I labour on 
In weakness and rejoicing
For in my need
His power is displayed

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To this I hold
My Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley 
He will lead

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh the night has been won
And I shall overcome
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No fate I dread
I know I am forgiven
The future sure 
The price it has been paid

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For Jesus bled 
And suffered for my pardon
And He was raised 
To overthrow the grave

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To this I hold
My sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh the chains are released
I can sing, "I am free"
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
With every breath 
I long to follow Jesus
For He has said 
That He will bring me home

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And day by day 
I know He will renew me
Until I stand 
With joy before the throne

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
To this I hold
My hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To this I hold
My hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
