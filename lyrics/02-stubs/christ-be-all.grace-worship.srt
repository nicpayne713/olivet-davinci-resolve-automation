1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

Oh to be 
Empty and lowly

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Meek and unnoticed
And unknown

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And to God, a vessel holy

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Filled with Christ
And Christ alone

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How great is God! 
His grandeur endless
How frail I come 
Before His throne

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am lost
In love relentless
That Christ be all
And I His own

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak
May Christ be all, and I be nothing

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I am poor
And I have nothing
All my deeds cannot avail

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But Christ 
endured the Father's crushing
He bowed His head, as Mercy bled, 
peace to prevail

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He bowed His head, as Mercy bled
peace to prevail

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak
May Christ be all, and I be nothing

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Bring me low
My heart lower still
That Your grace
My pride relieves

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
May these words 
Resound loud until
Every tribe 
And tongue believes

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Bring me low
My heart lower still
That Your grace
My pride relieves

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
May these words
Resound loud until
Every tribe
And tongue can sing

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
May Christ be all
And I be nothing

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
On golden shores
Of sure salvation
I will run to meet my King

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Freed from shame 
And all accusation
He'll give Himself
Nothing I'll bring

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He'll give Himself
Nothing I'll bring

24
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
