00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the Mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here I raise my Ebenezer
Here by Thy great help I’ve come
And I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh that day when freed from sinning
I shall see Thy lovely face
Clothed then in the blood washed linen
How I’ll sing Thy wondrous grace

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come my Lord no longer tarry
Take my ransomed soul away
Send Thine angels now to carry
Me to realms of endless day

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Prone to wander Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart Lord take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above
