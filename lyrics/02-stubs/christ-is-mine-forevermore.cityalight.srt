00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Mine are days that 
God has numbered
I was made to 
walk with Him

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yet I look for 
worldly treasure
And forsake the 
King of kings

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But mine is hope 
in my Redeemer
Though I fall
His love is sure

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For Christ has paid 
for every failing
I am His forevermore

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mine are tears in 
times of sorrow
Darkness not 
yet understood

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Through the valley 
I must travel
Where I see no 
earthly good

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But mine is peace 
that flows from Heaven
And the strength 
in times of need

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I know my pain 
will not be wasted
Christ completes 
his work in me

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mine are days here 
as a stranger
Pilgrim on a 
narrow way

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
One with Christ 
I will encounter
Harm and hatred 
for His name

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But mine is armour 
for this battle
Strong enough 
to last the war

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And He has said 
He will deliver
Safely to the 
golden shore

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And mine are keys 
to Zion city
Where beside 
the King I walk

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For there my heart 
has found its treasure
Christ is mine forevermore

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come rejoice now
O my soul
For His love 
is my reward

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Fear is gone and 
hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Come rejoice now
O my soul
For His love 
is my reward

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Fear is gone and 
hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Come rejoice now
O my soul
For His love is my reward

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Fear is gone and 
hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And mine are keys 
to Zion city
Where beside the King I walk
For there my heart has 
found its treasure

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Christ is mine forevermore
Christ is mine forevermore
Christ is mine forevermore
