00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Man of sorrows man of God
By his own betrayed
The sin of man and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus lain

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Silent as he stood accused
Beaten mocked and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto thee

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sent of Heaven God's own son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed him to that tree

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto thee

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood 
That my Jesus spilled

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now the curse of sin 
Has no hold on me
Whom the son sets free
Oh is free indeed

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood 
That my Jesus spilled

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now the curse of sin 
Has no hold on me
Whom the son sets free
Oh is free indeed

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto thee

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
See the stone is rolled away
Behold the empty tomb

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hallelujah God be praised
He's risen from the grave

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto thee
Praise and honour unto thee
