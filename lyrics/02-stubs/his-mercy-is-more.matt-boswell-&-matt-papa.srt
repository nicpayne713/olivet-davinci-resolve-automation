Stronger than darkness, new every morn
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

No wrongs we have done
Omniscient, all knowing
He counts not their sum

Without bottom or shore

As we constantly roam
What Father, so tender
Is calling us home

His life was the cost

We could never afford
Our sins they are many
His mercy is more
