00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Speak, O Lord
As we come to You
To receive the food 
Of Your Holy Word

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Take Your truth
Plant it deep in us
Shape and fashion us 
In Your likeness

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That the light of Christ 
Might be seen today
In our acts of love 
And our deeds of faith

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Speak, O Lord
And fulfill in us
All Your purposes 
For Your glory

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Teach us Lord
Full obedience
Holy reverence
True humility

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Test our thoughts 
And our attitudes
In the radiance 
Of Your purity

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cause our faith to rise
Cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love 
And authority

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Words of pow'r 
That can never fail
Let their truth prevail 
Over unbelief

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Speak, O Lord
And renew our minds
Help us grasp the heights 
Of Your plans for us

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Truths unchanged 
From the dawn of time
That will echo down 
Through eternity

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And by grace we'll stand 
On Your promises
And by faith we'll walk 
As You walk with us

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Speak, O Lord
Till Your church is built
And the earth is filled 
With Your glory
