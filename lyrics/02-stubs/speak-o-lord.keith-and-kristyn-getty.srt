00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Speak, O Lord
as we come to You
To receive the food 
of Your Holy Word

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Take Your truth
plant it deep in us
Shape and fashion us 
in Your likeness

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That the light of Christ 
might be seen today
In our acts of love 
and our deeds of faith

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Speak, O Lord
and fulfill in us
All Your purposes 
for Your glory

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Teach us Lord
full obedience
Holy reverence
true humility

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Test our thoughts 
and our attitudes
In the radiance 
of Your purity

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cause our faith to rise
cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love 
and authority

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Words of pow'r 
that can never fail
Let their truth prevail 
over unbelief

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Speak, O Lord
and renew our minds
Help us grasp the heights 
of Your plans for us

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Truths unchanged 
from the dawn of time
That will echo down 
through eternity

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And by grace we'll stand 
on Your promises
And by faith we'll walk 
as You walk with us

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Speak, O Lord
till Your church is built
And the earth is filled 
with Your glory
