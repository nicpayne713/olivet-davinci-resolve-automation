1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who is this, divine and tender
Hailing from eternal shores?
Once arrayed in highest splendor
Now in poverty adorned

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He is Jesus, God made mortal
Word in flesh, the Light of Life

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
From a throne room to a stable
Hope is born this holy night

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who is this of might and meekness
Given all authority?
With a word He stills the tempest
At His touch the blind can see

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He is Jesus our Messiah
Long awaited, long proclaimed

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sing "Hosanna in the highest!"
Christ the King has come to reign

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who is this reviled and stricken
Broken on a cursed tree?
Son of God by God forsaken
Drenched in our iniquity

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He is Jesus slain for sinners
Laiden with our guilt and grief

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All our praise to Him we render
For His wounds have won our peace

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For You've won our peace

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who is this entombed in darkness
Cast into the bitter depths?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He whom grave nor Hell could harness
Rose and tore the sting from death

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He is Jesus, God triumphant
Risen to the Father's side

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All will bow in awe and reverence
At the name of Jesus Christ

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He is Jesus, God triumphant
Risen to the Father's side

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All will bow in awe and reverence
At the name of Jesus Christ

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
