00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

We worship the God who was
We worship the God who is
We worship the God who 
evermore will be

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He opened the prison doors
He parted the raging sea
My God He holds the victory

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There's joy in the 
house of the Lord
There's joy in the 
house of the Lord today

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

5

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We sing to the God who heals
We sing to the God who saves
We sing to the God who 
always makes a way

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
'Cause He hung up on that cross
Then He rose up from that grave
My God's still rolling stones away

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There's joy in the 
house of the Lord
There's joy in the 
house of the Lord today

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We were the beggars
Now we're royalty
We were the prisoners
Now we're running free

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We are forgiven, accepted
Redeemed by His grace
Let the house of the 
Lord sing praise

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
'Cause we were the beggars
Now we're royalty
We were the prisoners
Now we're running free

We are forgiven, accepted
Redeemed by His grace

Lord sing praise

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord 
There's joy in the 
house of the Lord today
