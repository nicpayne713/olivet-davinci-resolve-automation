00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There is one Gospel 
On which I stand
For all eternity

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is my story
My Father's plan
The Son has rescued me

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh what a Gospel
Oh what a peace
My highest joy 
And my deepest need

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now and forever 
He is my light
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There is one Gospel 
To which I cling
All else I count as loss

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For there
Where justice and mercy meet
He saved me on the cross

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No more I boast in 
What I can bring
No more I carry 
The weight of sin

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For He has brought me 
From death to life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There is one Gospel 
Where hope is found
The empty tomb still speaks

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For death could not 
Keep my Saviour down
He lives and I am free

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now on my Saviour
I fix my eyes
My life is His 
And His hope is mine

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For He has promised 
I, too, will rise
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And in this Gospel 
The church is one
We do not walk alone

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We have His Spirit 
As we press on
To lead us safely home

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And when in glory 
Still I will sing
Of this old story 
That rescued me

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Praise to my Saviour
The King of life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And when in glory 
Still I will sing
Of this old story 
That rescued me

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Praise to my Saviour
The King of life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Praise to my Saviour
The King of life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ
