00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

There is one Gospel 
on which I stand
For all eternity

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is my story
my Father's plan
The Son has rescued me

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh what a Gospel
oh what a peace
My highest joy 
and my deepest need

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now and forever 
He is my light
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There is one Gospel 
to which I cling
All else I count as loss

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For there
where justice and mercy meet
He saved me on the cross

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No more I boast in 
what I can bring
No more I carry 
the weight of sin

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For He has brought me 
from death to life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There is one Gospel 
where hope is found
The empty tomb still speaks

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For death could not 
keep my Saviour down
He lives and I am free

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now on my Saviour
I fix my eyes
My life is His 
and His hope is mine

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For He has promised 
I, too, will rise
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And in this Gospel 
the church is one
We do not walk alone

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We have His Spirit 
as we press on
To lead us safely home

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And when in glory 
still I will sing
Of this old story 
that rescued me

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Praise to my Saviour
the King of life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And when in glory 
still I will sing
Of this old story 
that rescued me

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Praise to my Saviour
the King of life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Praise to my Saviour
the King of life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ
