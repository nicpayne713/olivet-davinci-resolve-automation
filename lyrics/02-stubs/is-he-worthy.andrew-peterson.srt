00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Do you feel the world is broken
(We do)
Do you feel the shadows deepen
(We do)

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But do you know
That all the dark won't
Stop the light
From getting through
(We do)

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Do you wish that you
Could see it all made new
(We do)

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is all creation groaning
(It is)
Is a new creation coming
(It is)

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is the glory of the Lord
To be the light within our midst
(It is)

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Is it good that we
Remind ourselves of this
(It is)

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is anyone worthy
Is anyone whole
Is anyone able to break the seal
And open the scroll

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Lion of Judah
Who conquered the grave
He was David's root
And the Lamb who died to ransom the slave

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is He worthy 
Is He worthy
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy of this

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He is

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Does the Father truly love us
(He does)
Does the Spirit move among us
(He does)

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And does Jesus our Messiah
Hold forever those He loves
(He does)

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Does our God intend to
Dwell again with us
(He does)

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is anyone worthy
Is anyone whole
Is anyone able to
Break the seal and open the scroll

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The Lion of Judah
Who conquered the grave
He is David's root
And the Lamb who died 
To ransom the slave

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
From every people and tribe
Every nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom
And priests to God
To reign with the Son

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is He worthy
Is He worthy
Of all blessing and honor and glory

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Is He worthy
Is He worthy
Is He worthy of this

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He is

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is He worthy
(Is He worthy)

22
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He is

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He is
