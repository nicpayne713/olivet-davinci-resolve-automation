1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In Christ alone
my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This cornerstone
this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest
drought and storm

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What heights of love
what depths of peace
When fears are stilled
when strivings cease

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ
I stand

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In Christ alone
who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This gift of love
and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ
I live

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There in the ground
His body lay
Light of the world
by darkness slain

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then bursting forth
in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost
its grip on me

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious
blood of Christ

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No guilt in life
no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From life's first cry
to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No power of hell
no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ
I'll stand

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No power of hell
no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ
I'll stand
