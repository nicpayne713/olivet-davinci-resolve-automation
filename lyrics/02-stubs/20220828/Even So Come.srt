00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All of creation
All of the earth
Make straight a highway
A path for the Lord

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Jesus is coming soon

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Call back the sinner
Wake up the saint
Let every nation shout of Your fame

Jesus is coming soon

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Like a bride waiting for her groom
We'll be at Church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing 

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Even so come
Lord Jesus, come

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Even so come
Lord Jesus, come 

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There will be justice
all will be new
Your name forever
faithful and true

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Jesus is coming soon

We'll be at Church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Even so come
Lord Jesus, come 
Even so come
Lord Jesus, come

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:60,000
So we wait
We wait for You
God, we wait
You're coming soon

00:00:60,000 --> 00:00:65,000
So we wait
We wait for You
God, we wait
You're coming soon
