00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise 
And treasures that fade
Are never enough

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You
There's nothing 
Better than You

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You, no

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord, You've seen them all
And You still call me friend

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
'Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
And there's not a place 
Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You
Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You
Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You
Lord, there's nothing 
Better than You

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
There's nothing
Oh, there's nothing better than You

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There's nothing 
Better than You
There's nothing
Nothing is better than You

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
