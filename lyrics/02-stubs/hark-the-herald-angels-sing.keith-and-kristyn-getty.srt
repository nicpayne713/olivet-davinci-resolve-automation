Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim

Late in time behold him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb

Ris'n with healing in his wings

Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the suns of earth
Born to give them second birth
