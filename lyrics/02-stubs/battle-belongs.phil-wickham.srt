00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When all I see is the battle
You see my victory

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When all I see is the mountain 
You see a mountain moved

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And as I walk through the shadow 
Your love surrounds me

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's nothing to fear now 
For I am safe with You

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So when I fight
I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God 
The battle belongs to You

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And every fear I Lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And if You are for me
Who can be against me

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For Jesus, there's nothing
Impossible for You

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When all I see are the ashes
You see the beauty
When all I see is a cross
God, You see the empty tomb

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So when I fight
I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Almighty fortress
You go before us
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You shine in the shadow
You win every battle
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
An almighty fortress
You go before us
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You shine in the shadow
You win every battle
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
An almighty fortress
You go before us
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You shine in the shadows
You win every battle
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So when I fight
I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

20
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh God
The battle belongs to You
