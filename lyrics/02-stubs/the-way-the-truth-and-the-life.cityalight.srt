00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I will fix my eyes on Christ
The one and only way
I will follow in His steps
He leads me day by day

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I won’t trust in empty words
That wash away like sand
I have heard the Gospel truth
And on that rock I stand

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I will follow the Son
He goes before me
Through death into glory
Preparing the way

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now death has no claim on me
My king rose from the grave
As He rose so I will rise
The Life has called my name

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Life has called my name

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will follow the Son
He goes before me
Through death into glory
Preparing the way

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will run the race
with hope and faith
No turning back
He leads the way

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
On that final day
with thanks and praise
I will run
through Heaven’s gates

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will run the race
with hope and faith
No turning back
He leads the way

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
On that final day
with thanks and praise
I will run
through Heaven’s gates

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I will follow the Son
He goes before me
Through death into glory
Preparing the way

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will follow the Son
He goes before me
Through death into glory
Preparing the way

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life
