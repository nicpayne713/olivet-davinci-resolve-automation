1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000

In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope, without light
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To rеdeem the whole creation
You did not dеspise the cross

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Praise forever to the King of Kings
