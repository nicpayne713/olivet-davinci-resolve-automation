1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A mighty fortress is our God
A bulwark never failing

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For still our ancient foe  
Doth seek to work us woe

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
His craft and power are great
And armed with cruel hate

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
On earth is not his equal
And though this world 
With devils filled

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Should threaten to undo us
We will not fear for God hath willed

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
His truth to triumph through us
The Prince of Darkness grim

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We tremble not for him
His rage we can endure

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For lo his doom is sure
One little word shall fell him

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That word above all earthly powers
No thanks to them abideth

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through him who with us sideth

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The body they may kill
God's truth abideth still
His kingdom is forever
