00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:39,500
Through the ages gone before
Through the trial and the sword
Many saints and martyrs conquered though they died

Still we're holding out the cross
Crossing ocean suffering loss
Shall endure all things to win the crown of life

<b>With the glories of the Gospel to explain</b>
<b>Now we pray Your kingdom come</b>
<b>And we pray Your will be done</b>
<b>For the honor and the glory of Your name</b>
