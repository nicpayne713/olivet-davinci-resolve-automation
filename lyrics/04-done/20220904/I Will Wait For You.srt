00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:25,333
<b>Lord, from the depths </b>
<b>I call to You</b>
<b>Lord, hear me from on high</b>

2
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:48,625
<b>And give attention </b>
<b>to my voice</b>
<b>When I for mercy cry</b>

3
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:20,083
<b>Out of the depths I cry to You</b>
<b>In darkest places I will call</b>
<b>Incline Your ear to me anew</b>
<b>And hear my cry for mercy, Lord</b>

4
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:41,083
<b>Were You to count my sinful ways</b>
<b>How could I come before Your throne</b>
<b>Yet full forgiveness meets my gaze</b>
<b>I stand redeemed by grace alone</b>

5
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:51,541
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>On Your word, I will rely</b>

6
00:01:51,541 --> 00:02:02,916
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>Surely wait for You</b>
<b>Till my soul is satisfied</b>

7
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:30,166
<b>So put your hope in God alone</b>
<b>Take courage in His power to save</b>
<b>Completely and forever won</b>
<b>By Christ emerging from the grave</b>

8
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:40,416
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>On Your word, I will rely</b>

9
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:52,250
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>Surely wait for You</b>
<b>Till my soul is satisfied</b>

10
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:19,291
<b>Now He has come to make a way</b>
<b>And God Himself has paid the price</b>
<b>That all who trust in Him today</b>
<b>Find healing in His sacrifice</b>

11
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:29,291
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>On Your word, I will rely</b>

12
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:39,708
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>Surely wait for You</b>
<b>Till my soul is satisfied</b>

13
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:49,958
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>Through the storm </b>
<b>and through the night</b>

14
00:03:49,958 --> 00:04:03,916
<b>I will wait for You</b>
<b>Surely wait for You</b>
<b>For Your love is my delight</b>

15
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:50,958
<b>I pray my soul waits for the Lord</b>
<b>My hope is in His word</b>
<b>More than the watchman waits for dawn</b>
<b>My soul waits for the Lord</b>
