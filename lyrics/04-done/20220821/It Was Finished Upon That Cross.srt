00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:38,791
<b>How I love the voice of Jesus</b>
<b>On the cross of Calvary</b>
<b>He declares His work is finished</b>
<b>He has spoken this hope to me</b>

2
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:57,541
<b>Though the sun had ceased its shining</b>
<b>Though the war appeared as lost</b>
<b>Christ had triumphed over evil</b>
<b>It was finished upon that cross</b>

3
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:23,666
<b>Now the curse, it has been broken</b>
<b>Jesus paid the price for me</b>
<b>Full, the pardon he has offered</b>
<b>Great, the welcome that I receive</b>

4
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:42,541
<b>Boldly, I approach my Father</b>
<b>Clothed in Jesus' righteousness</b>
<b>There is no more guilt to carry</b>
<b>It was finished upon that cross</b>

5
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:18,333
<b>Death was once my great opponent</b>
<b>Fear once had a hold on me</b>
<b>But the Son who died to save us</b>
<b>Rose that we would be free indeed!</b>

6
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:44,125
<b>Death was once my great opponent</b>
<b>Fear once had a hold on me</b>
<b>But the Son who died to save us</b>
<b>Rose that we would be free indeed!</b>

7
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:49,250
<b>Yes, He rose that we would be free indeed!</b>

8
00:02:49,250 --> 00:03:07,833
<b>Free from every plan of darkness</b>
<b>Free to live and free to love</b>
<b>Death is dead and Christ is risen!</b>
<b>It was finished upon that cross</b>

9
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:26,250
<b>Onward to eternal glory</b>
<b>To my Saviour and my God</b>
<b>I rejoice in Jesus' victory</b>
<b>It was finished upon that cross</b>

10
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:36,000
<b>It was finished upon that cross</b>
<b>It was finished upon that cross </b>
