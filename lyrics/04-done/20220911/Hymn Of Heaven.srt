00:00:03,416 --> 00:00:17,208
<b>How I long </b>
<b>to breathe the air of Heaven</b>
<b>Where pain is gone </b>
<b>and mercy fills the streets</b>

2
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:31,125
<b>To look upon </b>
<b>the one who bled to save me</b>
<b>And walk with Him </b>
<b>for all eternity</b>

3
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:47,083
<b>There will be a day</b>
<b>When all will bow before Him</b>
<b>There will be a day</b>
<b>When death will be no more</b>

4
00:00:47,083 --> 00:01:01,750
<b>Standing face to face</b>
<b>With He who died and rose again</b>
<b>Holy, Holy is the Lord</b>

5
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:18,166
<b>Every prayer </b>
<b>We prayed in desperation</b>
<b>The songs of faith</b>
<b>We sang through doubt and fear</b>

6
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:33,958
<b>In the end </b>
<b>We'll see that it was worth it</b>
<b>When He returns </b>
<b>to wipe away our tears</b>

7
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:48,083
<b>There will be a day</b>
<b>When all will bow before Him</b>
<b>There will be a day</b>
<b>When death will be no more</b>

8
00:01:48,083 --> 00:02:01,625
<b>Standing face to face</b>
<b>With He who died and rose again</b>
<b>Holy, Holy is the Lord</b>

9
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:18,958
<b>On that day </b>
<b>we join the resurrection</b>
<b>And stand beside </b>
<b>the heroes of the faith</b>

10
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:32,625
<b>With one voice </b>
<b>a thousand generations</b>
<b>Sing worthy is </b>
<b>the Lamb who was slain</b>

11
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:45,791
<b>On that day </b>
<b>We join the resurrection</b>
<b>And stand beside </b>
<b>the heroes of the faith</b>

12
00:02:45,791 --> 00:03:08,375
<b>With one voice </b>
<b>a thousand generations</b>
<b>Sing worthy is </b>
<b>the Lamb who was slain</b>
<b>Forever He shall reign</b>

13
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:22,458
<b>So let it be today</b>
<b>We shout the hymn of Heaven</b>
<b>With angels and the Saints</b>
<b>We raise a mighty roar</b>

14
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:35,750
<b>Glory to our God</b>
<b>Who gave us life beyond the grave</b>
<b>Holy, Holy is the Lord</b>

15
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:49,250
<b>So let it be today</b>
<b>We shout the hymn of Heaven</b>
<b>With angels and the Saints</b>
<b>We raise a mighty roar</b>

16
00:03:49,250 --> 00:04:03,958
<b>Glory to our God</b>
<b>Who gave us life beyond the grave</b>
<b>Holy, Holy is the Lord</b>

17
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:10,833
<b>Holy </b>
<b>Holy is the Lord</b>

18
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:17,666
<b>Holy </b>
<b>Holy is the Lord</b>
