00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:35,041
<b>Before the throne of God above</b>
<b>I have a strong and perfect plea</b>
<b>A great High Priest whose name is love</b>
<b>Who ever lives and pleads for me</b>

2
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:53,875
<b>My name is graven on His hands</b>
<b>My name is written on His heart</b>
<b>I know that while in heavâ€™n He stands</b>
<b>No tongue can bid me thence depart</b>

3
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:58,708
<b>No tongue can bid me thence depart</b>

4
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:26,250
<b>When Satan tempts me to despair</b>
<b>And tells me of the guilt within</b>
<b>Upward I look and see Him there</b>
<b>Who made an end to all my sin</b>

5
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:45,333
<b>Because the sinless Savior died</b>
<b>My sinful soul is counted free</b>
<b>For God the Just is satisfied</b>
<b>To look on Him and pardon me</b>

6
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:50,125
<b>To look on Him and pardon me</b>

7
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:25,625
<b>Behold Him there, the risen Lamb</b>
<b>My perfect, spotless Righteousness</b>
<b>The great unchangeable I AM</b>
<b>The King of glory and of grace</b>

8
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:44,416
<b>One with Himself, I cannot die</b>
<b>My soul is purchased by His blood</b>
<b>My life is hid with Christ on high</b>
<b>With Christ my Savior and my God</b>

9
00:02:44,666 --> 00:03:03,458
<b>One with Himself, I cannot die</b>
<b>My soul is purchased by His blood</b>
<b>My life is hid with Christ on high</b>
<b>With Christ my Savior and my God</b>

10
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:08,250
<b>With Christ my Savior and my God</b>

11
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,541
<b>With Christ my Savior and my God</b>
