Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

What love could remember 
No wrongs we have done
Omniscient, all knowing
He counts not their sum

Thrown into a sea 
Without bottom or shore
Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

What patience would wait 
As we constantly roam
What Father, so tender
Is calling us home

He welcomes the weakest
The vilest, the poor
Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

What riches of kindness 
He lavished on us
His blood was the payment
His life was the cost

We stood 'neath a debt 
We could never afford
Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
Our sins they are many, His mercy is m–ære
