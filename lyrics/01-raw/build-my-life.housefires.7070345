Worthy of every song 
we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise 
we could ever bring

Worthy of every breath 
we could ever breathe
We live for You
Oh, we live for you

Jesus, the Name above 
every other name
Jesus, the only One 
who could ever save

Worthy of every breath 
we could ever breathe
We live for You
We live for You

Holy, there is no one 
like You
There is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder

And show me who You are
And fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love 
to those around me

Jesus, the Name above 
every other name
Jesus, the only One 
who could ever save

Worthy of every breath 
we could ever breathe
We live for You
Oh, we live for You

Holy, there is no one 
like You
There is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder

And show me who You are
And fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love 
to those around me

And I will build my life
upon Your love
It is a firm foundation

And I will put my trust 
in You alone
And I will not be shaken

I will build my life 
upon Your love
It is a firm foundation

And I will put my trust 
in You alone
And I will not be shaken

Holy, there is no one 
like You
There is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder

And show me who You are
And fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love 
to those around me (You are holy, Lord)

And I will build my life 
upon Your love
It is a firm foundation

And I will put my trust 
in You alone
And I will not be shaken
