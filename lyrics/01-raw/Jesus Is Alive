There is now a hope 
That lasts beyond our days
For the One that once 
Was buried lives again

Now the tomb is bare and empty
And the stone is rolled away
Praise the Risen One 
Who overcame the grave

All you broken hearted
All you worn and weak
Come find living water
Everlasting streams

To the wandering spirit 
Lost and searching
Wanting something more

Find the Risen King 
Who overcomes the world

Let there be dancing 
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

No more condemnation
No more doubt and fear
For our sin and shame
They have no power here

In His resurrection perfect love 
Has set the captives free
Praise the Risen King 
Who stands in victory

Let there be dancing 
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

Let there be dancing
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

Hallelujah
Death is undone
Hallelujah
Jesus has won

Hallelujah
We overcome
Oh in Jesus
Oh in Jesus

Hallelujah
Death is undone
Hallelujah
Jesus has won

Hallelujah
We overcome
Oh in Jesus
Oh in Jesus

Hallelujah
Death is undone
Hallelujah
Jesus has won

Hallelujah
We overcome
Oh in Jesus
Oh in Jesus

Let there be dancing 
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

Let there be dancing 
In the darkness
And let our song break 
Through the night

Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive

Lift your voice and sing 
That Christ is King
For Jesus is Alive
