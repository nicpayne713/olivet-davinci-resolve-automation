The dark tried to hide You
And steal You away

Death tried to keep You
Inside of the grave

The enemy fought You
He tried but he lost

You cannot be stopped

When we cried for freedom
You tore down the walls

The weight of our burdens
You carried it all

Our fears and our failures
Hang dead on the cross

You cannot be stopped

Mover of mountains
Breaker of chains
Jesus has triumphed 
over the grave

Sing hallelujah
The battle is won
Nothing can stand 
against our God

We stand on Your victory
And shout out Your praise

Miracle maker
You're mighty to save

Awesome in power
Relentless in love

You cannot be stopped

Mover of mountains
Breaker of chains
Jesus has triumphed
over the grave

Sing hallelujah
The battle is won
Nothing can stand 
against our God

There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There's nothing 
that can stop our God

There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There is nothing 
There is nothing

There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There's nothing 
that can stop our God

There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There is nothing 
There is nothing

There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There's nothing 
that can stop our God

There's nothing 
that can stop our God
There is nothing

Mover of mountains
Breaker of chains
Jesus has triumphed 
over the grave

Sing hallelujah
The battle is won
Nothing can stand 
against our God

Sing hallelujah
The battle is won
Nothing can stand 
against our God
