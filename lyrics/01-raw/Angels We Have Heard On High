Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Shepherds why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavn'ly song

Gloria
In excelsis Deo
Gloria
In excelsis Deo

Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord our newborn King

Gloria
In excelsis Deo
Gloria
In excelsis Deo

See Him in a manger laid
Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth
Mary Joseph lend your aid
Sing with us our Savior's birth

Gloria
In excelsis Deo
Gloria
In excelsis Deo

Gloria
In excelsis Deo
Gloria
In excelsis Deo
