Hallelujah! 
All I have is Christ

Hallelujah! 
Jesus is my life

I once was lost 
in darkest night
Yet thought I 
knew the way

The sin that 
promised joy and life
Had led me 
to the grave

I had no hope 
that You would own
A rebel to 
Your will

And if You had 
not loved me first
I would refuse 
You still

But as I ran 
my hell-bound race
Indifferent to 
the cost

You looked upon 
my helpless state
And led me to 
the cross

And I beheld 
God's love displayed
You suffered 
in my place

You bore the wrath 
reserved for me
Now all I know 
is grace

Hallelujah! 
All I have is Christ

Hallelujah! 
Jesus is my life

Hallelujah! 
All I have is Christ

Hallelujah! 
Jesus is my life

Now, Lord, 
I would be Yours alone
And live so all 
might see

The strength to follow 
Your commands
Could never come 
from me

Oh Father, use 
my ransomed life in any way You choose
Oh Father, use 
my ransomed life in any way You choose

And let my soul 
forever be 
my only boast 
is you

Hallelujah! 
All I have is Christ

Hallelujah! 
Jesus is my life

Hallelujah! 
All I have is Christ

Hallelujah! 
Jesus is my life

Hallelujah! 
All I have is Christ

Hallelujah! 
Jesus is my life
