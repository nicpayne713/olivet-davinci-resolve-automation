When the music fades
And all is stripped away
And I simply come

Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless your heart

I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required

You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the 
Heart of worship
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

I'm sorry Lord for 
The thing I've made it
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve

Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is yours
Every single breath

I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required

You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the 
Heart of worship
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

I'm sorry Lord for the 
Thing I've made it
It's all about you
It's all about you Lord

I'm coming back to the 
Heart of worship
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

I'm sorry Lord for the 
Thing I've made it
It's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus

I'll bring you more than a song
More than a song

By your grace, God
I'll bring you more than a song
More than a song

By your grace, God
I'll bring you more than a song
More than a song
