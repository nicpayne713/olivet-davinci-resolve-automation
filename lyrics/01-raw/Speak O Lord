Speak, O Lord
As we come to You
To receive the food 
Of Your Holy Word

Take Your truth
Plant it deep in us
Shape and fashion us 
In Your likeness

That the light of Christ 
Might be seen today
In our acts of love 
And our deeds of faith

Speak, O Lord
And fulfill in us
All Your purposes 
For Your glory

Teach us Lord
Full obedience
Holy reverence
True humility

Test our thoughts 
And our attitudes
In the radiance 
Of Your purity

Cause our faith to rise
Cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love 
And authority

Words of pow'r 
That can never fail
Let their truth prevail 
Over unbelief

Speak, O Lord
And renew our minds
Help us grasp the heights 
Of Your plans for us

Truths unchanged 
From the dawn of time
That will echo down 
Through eternity

And by grace we'll stand 
On Your promises
And by faith we'll walk 
As You walk with us

Speak, O Lord
Till Your church is built
And the earth is filled 
With Your glory
