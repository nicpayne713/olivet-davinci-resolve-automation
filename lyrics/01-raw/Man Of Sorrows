Man of sorrows man of God
By his own betrayed
The sin of man and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus lain

Silent as he stood accused
Beaten mocked and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns

Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto thee

Sent of Heaven God's own son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed him to that tree

Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto thee

Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood 
That my Jesus spilled

Now the curse of sin 
Has no hold on me
Whom the son sets free
Oh is free indeed

Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood 
That my Jesus spilled

Now the curse of sin 
Has no hold on me
Whom the son sets free
Oh is free indeed

Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto thee

See the stone is rolled away
Behold the empty tomb

Hallelujah God be praised
He's risen from the grave

Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto thee
Praise and honour unto thee
