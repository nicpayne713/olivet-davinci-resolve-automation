Who has held the oceans in his hands?
Who has numbered every grain of sand?
Kings and nations tremble at his voice
All creation rises to rejoice

Behold our God
seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him

Who has given counsel to the Lord?
Who can question any of his words?
Who can teach, the one who knows all things?
Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?

Behold our God
seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him

Who has felt the nails upon his hands?
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man
God eternal, humbled to the grave
Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign

Behold our God
seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him


# Marco'd Greg to ask about this
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill-)

Behold our God
seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
nothing can compare
Come, let us adore

Behold our God
seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him
