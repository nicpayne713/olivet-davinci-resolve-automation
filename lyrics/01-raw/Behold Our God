Who has held the 
Oceans in his hands?
Who has numbered 
Every grain of sand?

Kings and nations 
Tremble at his voice
All creation rises to rejoice

Behold our God
Seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him

Who has given 
Counsel to the Lord?
Who can question 
Any of his words?

Who can teach
The one who knows all things?
Who can fathom 
All his wondrous deeds?

Behold our God
Seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him

Who has felt the 
Nails upon his hands?
Bearing all the 
Guilt of sinful man

God eternal 
Humbled to the grave
Jesus, Savior
Risen now to reign

Behold our God
Seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him

# Marco'd Greg to ask about this
You will reign forever
(let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever
(let Your glory fill the Earth)

You will reign forever
(let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever
(let Your glory fill the Earth)

You will reign forever
(let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever
(let Your glory fill the Earth)

You will reign forever
(let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever
(let Your glory fill-)

Behold our God
seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
nothing can compare
Come, let us adore

Behold our God
seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him

Behold our king
nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him
