When the enemy surrounds
And my heart grows faint within
When the darkness overwhelms
And my fears are pressing in

I will trust in You
Oh, Lord
In the silence I will wait
I will stand upon Your word

You're my solid rock
And my salvation
My steadfast hope
That won't be shaken

My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

You're my stronghold and my shield
In the midst of every threat
Though the wicked never yield
They will vanish like a breath

Yes I know the outcome's sure
Satan's evil plans will fail
In Your power I'm secure

You're my solid rock
And my salvation
My steadfast hope
That won't be shaken

My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

You're my comfort
When I feel forsaken
My refuge and
My sure foundation

My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

This is love I can't explain
This is mercy unreserved
Through Your sacrifice so great
I have peace that's undeserved

For the battle has been won
And I fear no shame or loss
Now the sting of death is gone

You're my solid rock
And my salvation
My steadfast hope
That won't be shaken

My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

You're my comfort
When I feel forsaken
My refuge and
My sure foundation

My soul will wait
My soul will wait 
For You

Hearts before You

Pouring out our 
Hearts before You
