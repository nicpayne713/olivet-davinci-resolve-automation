I'm alive because You're alive
I am free 'cause You set me free
I'm alive, I'm alive in You, Jesus
I am Yours 'cause You said it's so
I am loved and You won't let go
I'm alive, I'm alive in You, Jesus

O Spirit come set our hearts with holy fire
This hope we have, our God's not dead He is alive

And He is Jesus, nothing and no one can stop Him
And nothing is strong as our God is
Our God is alive, oh-oh-ooh
Our God is alive, oh-oh-ooh

Hey death, where is your sting?
No sin has claim on me
I'm alive, I'm alive in You, Jesus
Oh, no grave could hold my King
And He Stands in victory
He's alive, He's alive in me, Jesus
Oh, You're alive, You're alive in me, Jesus

And He is Jesus, nothing and no one can stop Him
And nothing is strong as our God is
Our God is alive
And He is risen, and now we are walking in freedom
And nothing is strong as our Jesus
Our God is alive, oh-oh-ooh
Our God is alive, oh-oh-ooh

So let praise rise high in this place
For our King stands over the grave
So let praise rise high in this place
For our King stands over the grave
O let praise rise high in this place
For our King stands over the grave
O let praise rise high in this place
For our King stands over the grave!
