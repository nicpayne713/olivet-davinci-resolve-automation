Who else commands 
All the hosts of heaven?
Who else could make 
Every king bow down?

Who else can whisper 
And darkness trembles?

Only a Holy God

What other beauty 
Demands such praises?
What other splendour 
Outshines the sun?

What other majesty 
Rules with justice?

Only a Holy God

Come and behold Him
The One and the Only

Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God

What other glory 
Consumes like fire?
What other power
Can raise the dead?

What other name
Remains undefeated?

Only a Holy God

Come and behold Him
The One and the Only

Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God

Come and behold Him
The One and the Only

Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God

Who else could rescue 
Me from my failing?
Who else would offer 
His only Son?

Who else invites me 
To call Him Father?

Only a Holy God
Only my Holy God

Come and behold Him
The One and the Only

Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God

Come and behold Him
The One and the Only

Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God

Come and behold Him
The One and the Only

Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God
