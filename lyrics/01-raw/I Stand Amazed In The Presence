I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner condemned unclean

How marvelous How wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous How wonderful
Is my Savior’s love for me

For me it was in the garden
He prayed: Not my will but Thine
He had no tears for His own griefs
But sweat-drops of blood for mine

In pity angels beheld Him
And came from the world of light
To strengthen Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv’ry
And suffered and died alone

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me
