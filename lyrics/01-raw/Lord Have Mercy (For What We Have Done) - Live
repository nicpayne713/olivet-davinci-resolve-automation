For what we have done
and left undone
We fall on Your countless mercies

For sins that are known
and those unknown
We call on Your name so holy

For envy and pride
for closing our eyes
For scorning our very neighbor

In thought word and deed
we've failed You our King
How deeply we need a Savior

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

For what You have done 
Your life of love
You perfectly lived we praise You

Though tempted and tried
You fixed Your eyes
You finished the work God gave You

And there on the tree
a King among thieves
You bled for a world's betrayal

You loved to the end
our merciful friend
How pure and forever faithful

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

For hearts that are cold
for seizing control
For scorning our very Maker

In thought word and deed
we've failed You our King
How deeply we need a Savior

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy 
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us
