We worship the God who was
We worship the God who is
We worship the God who 
evermore will be

He opened the prison doors
He parted the raging sea
My God He holds the victory

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord
There's joy in the 
house of the Lord today

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

We sing to the God who heals
We sing to the God who saves
We sing to the God who 
always makes a way

'Cause He hung up on that cross
Then He rose up from that grave
My God's still rolling stones away

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord
There's joy in the 
house of the Lord today

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

We were the beggars
Now we're royalty
We were the prisoners
Now we're running free

We are forgiven, accepted
Redeemed by His grace
Let the house of the 
Lord sing praise

'Cause we were the beggars
Now we're royalty
We were the prisoners
Now we're running free

We are forgiven, accepted
Redeemed by His grace
Let the house of the 
Lord sing praise

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord 
There's joy in the 
house of the Lord today

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord
There's joy in the 
house of the Lord today

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

There's joy in the 
house of the Lord 
Our God is surely in this place

And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

We shout out Your praise
We shout out Your praise
We shout out Your praise
