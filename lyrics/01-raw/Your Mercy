        I was alone
I couldn't find my place
'Til Heaven reached down 
Your love it called my name

Out of my shame
Out of the dead of night
Into a hope
into Your marvelous light

It's Your mercy
I don't deserve Your mercy
That You would reach down for me 
and keep me as Your own

For Your glory
I'm living for Your glory
And I will tell the story 
of Your unfailing love

Be glorified
Be lifted high
In all my life
Be glorified

Though I may run
Though I may fall apart
Chasing this world
Things that will break Your heart

But faithful and true
Sure as the rising sun
One thing is true
One thing is sure to come

It's Your mercy
I don't deserve Your mercy
That You would reach down for me 
And keep me as Your own

For Your glory
I'm living for Your glory
And I will tell the story 
of Your unfailing love

Be glorified
be lifted high
In all my life
be glorified

Be glorified
be lifted high
In all my life
be glorified

Be glorified

Be glorified

Oh, I've tasted and seen 
that You are good
And You're walking with me
just like You said You would

And all that You say
every word is true
Oh, whom should I trust?
Jesus, I trust in You

Oh, I've tasted and seen
that You are good
And You're walking with me 
just like You said You would

And all that You say
every word is true
Oh, whom should I trust?
Jesus, I trust in You

Be glorified
be lifted high
In all my life
be glorified

Be glorified
be lifted high
In all my life
be glorified

Be glorified

It's Your mercy
I don't deserve Your mercy
That You would reach down for 
me and keep me as Your own

For Your glory
I'm living for Your glory
And I will tell the story 
of Your unfailing love

Your unfailing love
