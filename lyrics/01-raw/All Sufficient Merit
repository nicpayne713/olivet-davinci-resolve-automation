All sufficient merit 
Shining like the sun
A fortune I inherit 
By no work I have done

My righteousness I forfeit 
At my Savior's cross
Where all sufficient merit 
Did what I could not

In love He condescended 
Eternal now in time
A life without a blemish 
The Maker made to die

The law could never save us
Our lawlessness had won
Until the pure and spotless 
Lamb had finally come

It is done, it is finished
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

I lay down my garments
Any empty boasts
Good works all corrupted 
By the sinful host

I'm dressed in my Lord Jesus
A crimson robe made white
No more fear of judgement
His righteousness is mine

It is done, it is finished
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

It is done, it is finished
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

All sufficient merit
Firm in life and death
The joy of my salvation 
Shall be my final breath

And when I stand accepted 
Before the throne of God
I'll gaze upon my Jesus 
And thank Him for the cross

Yes I'll thank You for the cross

It is done, it is finishe
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

It is done, it is finished
No more debt I owe
Paid in full
All sufficient merit now my own

Your Merit now my own
Your Merit now my own
