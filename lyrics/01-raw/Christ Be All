Oh, to be empty and lowly
Meek and unnoticed and unknown
And to God, a vessel Holy
Filled with Christ, and Christ alone
How great is God?
His grandeur endless
How frail I come before His throne
I am lost in love relentless
That Christ be all, and I his own
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in the vessels weak
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
I am poor, and I have nothing
All my deeds cannot avail
But Christ endured the Father's crushing
He bowed His head as mercy bled
Peace to prevail
He bowed His head as mercy bled
Peace to prevail
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in the vessels weak
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
Bring me low, my heart lower still
That Your grace my pride relieves
May these words resound loud until
Every tribe and tongue believes
Bring me low, my heart lower still
That Your grace my pride relieves
May these words resound loud until
Every tribe and tongue can sing
May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak
May Christ be all all, and I be nothing
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
On golden shores of sure salvation
I will run to meet my King
Free from shame and all accusation
He'll give Himself
Nothing I'll bring
He'll give Himself
Nothing I'll bring
