Oh to be 
Empty and lowly

Meek and unnoticed
And unknown

And to God, a vessel holy

Filled with Christ
And Christ alone

How great is God! 
His grandeur endless
How frail I come 
Before His throne

I am lost
In love relentless
That Christ be all
And I His own

May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak
May Christ be all, and I be nothing

This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me

I am poor
And I have nothing
All my deeds cannot avail

But Christ 
endured the Father's crushing
He bowed His head, as Mercy bled, 
peace to prevail

He bowed His head, as Mercy bled
peace to prevail

May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak
May Christ be all, and I be nothing

This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me

Bring me low
My heart lower still
That Your grace
My pride relieves

May these words 
Resound loud until
Every tribe 
And tongue believes

Bring me low
My heart lower still
That Your grace
My pride relieves

May these words
Resound loud until
Every tribe
And tongue can sing

May Christ be all, and I be nothing
His glory shines in vessels weak

May Christ be all
And I be nothing

This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me
This is my hope
Not I, but Christ in me

On golden shores
Of sure salvation
I will run to meet my King

Freed from shame 
And all accusation
He'll give Himself
Nothing I'll bring

He'll give Himself
Nothing I'll bring
