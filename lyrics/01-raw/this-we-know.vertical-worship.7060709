        You are who say You are
You'll do what You say You'll do
You'll be who You've always been to us
Jesus

Our hope is in You alone
Our strength in Your mighty name
Our peace in the darkest day remains
Jesus

This we know
We will see the enemy run
This we know
We will see the victory come

We hold on to every promise
You ever made
Jesus, You are unfailing

Our God through the wilderness
And our joy in the heaviness
Our way when it seems there is no way
Jesus

Your ways are higher than our own

We trust You, we trust You
Your ways are higher than our own
