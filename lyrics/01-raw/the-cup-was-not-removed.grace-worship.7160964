        The cup was not removed
He drank it all
See Him hanging there 
where I belong

His tears were as scarlet
But there in the garden
The cup was not removed

O praise the Lamb 
who takes away my sin
He tore the veil
now I can enter in

For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

The law was not removed
it was fulfilled
The prayers of all 
the prophets now revealed

In the image of the Father
The yes of every promise
The law was not removed

O praise the Lamb 
who takes away my sin
He tore the veil
now I can enter in

For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

O praise the One 
with scars in His hands
O praise the Son 
who died and rose again

For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

My sins are now removed
yes every one
Taken by my Jesus 
on the cross

As far as east and west
I see His righteousness

My sins are now removed
My sins are now removed
O praise Him, O praise Him

O praise the Lamb 
who takes away my sin
He tore the veil
now I can enter in

For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

O praise the One 
with scars in His hands
O praise the Son 
who died and rose again

For all my days 
my soul will praise Him
For all my days 
my soul will praise Him

The cup was not removed
He drank it all
See Him hanging there where I belong

O praise the Lamb 
who takes away my sin
He tore the veil
now I can enter in

For all my days 
my soul will praise Him
