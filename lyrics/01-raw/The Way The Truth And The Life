I will fix my eyes on Christ
The one and only way
I will follow in His steps
He leads me day by day

I won’t trust in empty words
That wash away like sand
I have heard the Gospel truth
And on that rock I stand

I will follow the Son
He goes before me
Through death into glory
Preparing the way

Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life

Now death has no claim on me
My king rose from the grave
As He rose so I will rise
The Life has called my name

The Life has called my name

I will follow the Son
He goes before me
Through death into glory
Preparing the way

Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life

I will run the race
with hope and faith
No turning back
He leads the way

On that final day
with thanks and praise
I will run
through Heaven’s gates

I will run the race
with hope and faith
No turning back
He leads the way

On that final day
with thanks and praise
I will run
through Heaven’s gates

I will follow the Son
He goes before me
Through death into glory
Preparing the way

Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life

I will follow the Son
He goes before me
Through death into glory
Preparing the way

Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life

Til the day He returns
I walk with assurance
For I know the Way
and the Truth and the Life
