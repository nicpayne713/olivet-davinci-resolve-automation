Great is Thy faithfulness 
O God my Father
There is no shadow of 
Turning with Thee

Thou changest not
Thy compassions they fail not
As Thou hast been
Thou forever will be

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning 
New mercies I see

All I have needed 
Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness
Lord unto me

I could not love Thee
So blind and unfeeling
Covenant promises 
Fell not to me

Then without warning
Desire or deserving
I found my Treasure
My pleasure in Thee

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning 
New mercies I see

And all I have needed 
Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness
Lord unto me

I have no merit 
To woo or delight Thee
I have no wisdom 
Or pow'rs to employ

And yet in Thy mercy
How pleasing Thou find'st me
This is Thy pleasure
That Thou art my joy

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning 
New mercies I see

And all I have needed 
Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness
Lord unto me

Oh, how great You are
Oh, how great You are
Sing about this
As we sing this

He's pardoned us
He's given us an everlasting peace
We are thankful for that
Let's thank Him together

Pardon for sin and 
A peace that endureth
Thine own dear presence 
To cheer and to guide

Strength for today and 
Bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine
With ten thousand beside

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning 
New mercies I see

And all I have needed 
Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness

Great is Thy faithfulness
Lord unto me
