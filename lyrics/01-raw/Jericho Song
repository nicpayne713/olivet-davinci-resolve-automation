We're drowning out the lies of the enemy
We're turning up the anthem that set us free
Your mighty name will ever be
The soundtrack of our victory
We're lifting up Your praise like a battle cry
The thunder of Your name breaks apart the night
Your matchless grace will ever be
The soundtrack of our victory
Our God, You will tear down the walls
Our God, You are invincible
The strongholds crumble like castles of sand
As we shout loud our Jericho song
Yes, all around the world, we're the church alive
We're fighting on our knees with revival fire
Our King shall reign and ever be
The soundtrack of our victory
Our God, You will tear down the walls
Our God, You are invincible
The strongholds crumble like castles of sand
As we shout loud our Jericho song
Our God, You will tear down the walls
Our God, You are invincible
The strongholds crumble like castles of sand
As we shout loud our Jericho song
Every wall is crumblin', is tumblin' down
Every wall is crumblin', is tumblin' down
Every wall is crumblin', is tumblin' down
At Your name, Jesus
Every wall is crumblin', is tumblin' down
Every wall is crumblin', is tumblin' down
Every wall is crumblin', is tumblin' down
At Your name, Jesus
Our God, You will tear down the walls
Our God, You are invincible
The strongholds crumble like castles of sand
As we shout loud, as we shout loud
As we shout loud our Jericho song
