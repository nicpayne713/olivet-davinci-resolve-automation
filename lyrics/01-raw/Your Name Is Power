You're the only answer
To the darkness
You're the only right
Among the wrong

You're the only hope
Among the chaos
You are the voice
That calls me on

Louder than every lie
Our sword in every fight
The truth will chase
Away the night

Your name is
Power over darkness
Freedom for the captives
Mercy for the broken
And the hopeless

Your name is
Faithful in the battle
Glory in the struggle
Mighty, it won't let us down
Or fail us

Your name is power
Your name is power

I know it is written
Hope is certain
I know that the word
Will never fail

I know that in every situation
You speak the power to prevail

Louder than every lie
Our sword in every fight
The truth will chase
Away the night

Your name is
Power over darkness
Freedom for the captives
Mercy for the broken
And the hopeless

Your name is
Faithful in the battle
Glory in the struggle
Mighty, it won't let us down
Or fail us

Your name is power
Your name is power

When you speak
You scatter darkness
Light arrives and heaven opens

Holy spirit
Let us hear it

When you speak
The church awakens
We believe the change is coming

Holy spirit
Let us see it

When you speak
You scatter darkness
Light arrives and heaven opens

Holy spirit
Let us hear it

When you speak
The church awakens
We believe the change is coming

Holy spirit
Let us see it

Your name is
Power over darkness
Freedom for the captives
Mercy for the broken
And the hopeless

Your name is
Faithful in the battle
Glory in the struggle
Mighty, it won't let us down
Or fail us

Your name is
Power over darkness
Your name is
Power in the chaos
Your name is power
