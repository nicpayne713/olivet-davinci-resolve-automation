Oh, to see the dawn 
of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary

Tried by sinful men
torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood

This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

Oh, to see the pain 
written on Your face
Bearing the awesome 
weight of sin

Ev'ry bitter thought
ev'ry evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

Now the daylight flees
now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head

Curtain torn in two
dead are raised to life
Finished the vict'ry cry

Oh, to see my name
written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free

Death is crushed to death
life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

Oh, to see my name
written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free

Death is crushed to death
life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

This, the power of the cross
Son of God, slain for us
What a love, what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross

This, the power of the cross
Son of God, slain for us
What a love, what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross
