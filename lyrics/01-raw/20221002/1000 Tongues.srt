We are a sea of voices
We are an ocean of your praise
Gathered under one name

We are a tide that's rising
And we cannot be contained
Gathered under one name

O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord
God Almighty

O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
You are worthy God

We have found our anthem
At the cross where sin was slain
Gathered under one name

Where every chain is broken
Every sorrow swept away
Gathered under one name

O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord
God Almighty

O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
You are worthy God

With all heaven sing
And all earth below
One holy King
One highest throne

With all heaven sing
And all earth below
One holy King
One highest throne

O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord
God Almighty

O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
Yes, You are so worthy God

O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord
God Almighty

O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
You are worthy God


Yes, You are so worthy God
