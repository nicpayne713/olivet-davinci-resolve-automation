 I love You Lord
Oh Your mercy never fails me
All my days
I've been held by Your hands

From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh I will sing of the goodness of God

All my life 
You have been faithful
All my life 
You have been so, so good

With every breath that I am able
Oh I will sing 
of the goodness of God

I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
In darkest nights
You are close like no other

I've known You as a father
I've known You as a friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God

All my life 
You have been faithful
All my life 
You have been so, so good

With every breath that I am able
Oh I will sing 
of the goodness of God

'Cause Your goodness is running after
it's running after me

Your goodness is running after
it's running after me

With my life laid down
I surrender now
I give You everything
Your goodness is running after
it's running after me

Your goodness is running after
it's running after me
Your goodness is running after
it's running after me

With my life laid down
I surrender now
I give You everything
Your goodness is running after
 it's running after me

Your goodness is running after
it's running after me

All my life 
You have been faithful
All my life 
You have been so, so good

With every breath that I am able
Oh I will sing 
of the goodness of God

All my life 
You have been faithful
All my life 
You have been so, so good

With every breath that I am able
Oh I will sing 
of the goodness of God

Oh I will sing 
of the goodness of God
