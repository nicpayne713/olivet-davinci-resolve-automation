        I'm alive 
because You're alive
I am free 
'cause You set me free
I'm alive, I'm alive in You, Jesus

I am Yours 
'cause You said it's so
I am loved 
and You won't let go
I'm alive, I'm alive in You, Jesus

O Spirit 
come set our hearts with holy fire
This hope we have
our God's not dead He is alive

And He is Jesus
Nothing and no one can stop Him
And nothing's as strong as our God is

Our God is alive

Our God is alive

Hey death
where is your sting?
No sin 
has claim on me
I'm alive, I'm alive in You, Jesus

Oh, there's no grave 
that could hold my King
And He Stands 
in victory
He's alive, He's alive in me, Jesus

Oh, You're alive
You're alive in me, Jesus

And He is Jesus
nothing and no one can stop Him
There's nothing as strong as our God is

Our God is alive

And He is risen
Now we are walking in freedom
There's nothing as strong as our Jesus

Our God is alive

Our God is alive

So let praise rise 
high in this place
For our King 
stands over the grave

So let praise rise 
high in this place
For our King 
stands over the grave

O let praise rise 
high in this place
For our King 
stands over the grave

O let praise rise 
high in this place
For our King 
stands over the grave

And He is Jesus
nothing and no one can stop Him
There's nothing as strong as our God is

Our God is alive

And He is risen
Now we are walking in freedom
There's nothing as strong as our Jesus

Our God is alive

Our God is alive

O let praise rise 
high in this place
For our King 
stands over the grave
