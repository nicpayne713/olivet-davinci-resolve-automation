There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel's veins

And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains

And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day

And there may I, though vile as he
Wash all my sins away

Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away

And there may I, though vile as he
Wash all my sins away

Hallelujah
Fountain full of love for us
Poured out on us

Hallelujah
Fountain full of love for us
Poured out on us

Hallelujah
Fountain full of love for us
Poured out on us

Hallelujah
Fountain full of love for us
Poured out

Ever since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply

Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be 'til I die

And shall be 'til I die
And shall be 'til I die

Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be 'til I die
