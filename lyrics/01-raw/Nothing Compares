[Verse 1]
The void became the universe
Responding to Your word

The sky above
And earth beneath
The garden from the dirt

[Verse 2]
Your voice ignites
The galaxies
The tapestry of stars

In majesty and gravity
You've shown us who You are

[Chorus]
All praise and honor
To Your name
You're worthy You're worthy

With saints and angels
We will say
You're Holy You're Holy

[Verse 3]
You gave Your love
To enemies
Your son upon the cross

The blood he shed in agony
Has madе a way for us

[Verse 4]
His the image of
Your radiance
And thе imprint of Your heart

In sacrifice and faithfulness
You've shown us who You are

[Chorus]
All praise and honor
To Your name
You're worthy You're worthy

With saints and angels
We will say
You're Holy You're Holy
