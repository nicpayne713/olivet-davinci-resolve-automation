A mighty fortress is our God
A bulwark never failing

Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing

For still our ancient foe  
Doth seek to work us woe

His craft and power are great
And armed with cruel hate

On earth is not his equal
And though this world 
With devils filled

Should threaten to undo us
We will not fear for God hath willed

His truth to triumph through us
The Prince of Darkness grim

We tremble not for him
His rage we can endure

For lo his doom is sure
One little word shall fell him

That word above all earthly powers
No thanks to them abideth

The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through him who with us sideth

Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also

The body they may kill
God's truth abideth still
His kingdom is forever
