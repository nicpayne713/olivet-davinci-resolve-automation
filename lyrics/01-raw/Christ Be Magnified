Were creation 
suddenly articulate
With a thousand 
tongues to life one cry

Then from the north to south 
and east to west
We's hear 
Christ be magnified

Were the whole earth 
echoing His Eminence
His name would 
burst from sea and sky

From rivers 
to the mountaintops
We'd hear 
Christ be magnified

Oh Christ be magnified
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me

Oh Christ be magnified
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me

When every creature 
finds its inmost melody
And every human 
heart its native cry

Oh then in one 
enraptured hymn of praise
We'll sing 
Christ be magnified

Oh Christ be magnified
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me

Oh Christ be magnified
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me

I won't bow to idols
I'll stand strong 
and worship You

If it puts me in the fire
I'll rejoice 
'cause You're there too

I won't be formed by feelings
I hold fast 
to what is true

If the cross 
brings transformation
Then I'll be 
crucified with You

Cause death 
is just the doorway
Into resurrection life

If I join You 
in your sufferings
Then I'll join You 
when You rise

And when You 
return in glory
With all the angels 
and the saints

My heart will 
still be singing
And my song 
will be the same

Oh Christ be magnified
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me

Oh Christ be magnified
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me

Oh Christ be magnified
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me

Oh Christ be magnified
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me
