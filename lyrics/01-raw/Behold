Behold the King has come
Divinity incarnate
Creator of the world
Breathing our air

Behold what light has come
And the dark cannot contain it
The Savior of the world
Is finally here

Oh come let us adore Him
Come let us adore Him
For He alone is worthy
Christ the Lord

Behold, the Father's love
Beyond all comprehension
He gave His only Son
To die in our place

Go and see that empty tomb
He's not there for He is risen
Every heart prepare Him room
Jesus Christ the King of Heaven

Oh come let us adore Him
Come let us adore Him
For He alone is worthy
Christ the Lord

We give You all the glory
We give You all the glory
We give You all the glory
Christ the Lord

We give You all the glory
We give You all the glory
We give You all the glory
Christ the Lord

We praise Your name
We praise Your name

Jesus, we praise Your name forever
Christ the Lord

Oh come let us adore Him
Come let us adore Him
For He alone is worthy
Christ the Lord

Oh come let us adore Him
Come let us come adore Him
For He alone is worthy
Christ the Lord

Christ the Lord

He is Christ the Lord
