I need Thee ev'ry hour
Most gracious Lord
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford

I need Thee oh I need Thee
Ev'ry hour I need Thee
Oh bless me now my Savior
I come to Thee

I need Thee ev'ry hour
Stay Thou nearby
Temptations lose their powâ€™r
When Thou art nigh

I need Thee oh I need Thee
Ev'ry hour I need Thee
Oh bless me now my Savior
I come to Thee

I need Thee ev'ry hour
In joy or pain
Come quickly and abide
Or life is vain

I need Thee oh I need Thee
Ev'ry hour I need Thee
Oh bless me now my Savior
I come to Thee

I need Thee ev'ry hour
Teach me Thy will
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfill

I need Thee oh I need Thee
Ev'ry hour I need Thee
Oh bless me now my Savior
I come to Thee
