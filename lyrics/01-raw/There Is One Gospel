There is one Gospel 
on which I stand
For all eternity

It is my story
my Father's plan
The Son has rescued me

Oh what a Gospel
oh what a peace
My highest joy 
and my deepest need

Now and forever 
He is my light
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

There is one Gospel 
to which I cling
All else I count as loss

For there
where justice and mercy meet
He saved me on the cross

No more I boast in 
what I can bring
No more I carry 
the weight of sin

For He has brought me 
from death to life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

There is one Gospel 
where hope is found
The empty tomb still speaks

For death could not 
keep my Saviour down
He lives and I am free

Now on my Saviour
I fix my eyes
My life is His 
and His hope is mine

For He has promised 
I, too, will rise
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

And in this Gospel 
the church is one
We do not walk alone

We have His Spirit 
as we press on
To lead us safely home

And when in glory 
still I will sing
Of this old story 
that rescued me

Praise to my Saviour
the King of life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

And when in glory 
still I will sing
Of this old story 
that rescued me

Praise to my Saviour
the King of life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

Praise to my Saviour
the King of life
I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ

I stand in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ
