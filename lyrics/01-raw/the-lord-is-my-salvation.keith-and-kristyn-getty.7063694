        The grace of God has reached for me
And pulled me from the raging sea
And I am safe on the solid ground
The Lord is my salvation

I will not fear when darkness falls
His strength will help me scale these walls
I'll see the dawn of the rising sun
The Lord is my salvation

Who is like the Lord our God?
Strong to save faithful in love
My debt is paid, and the victory won
The Lord is my salvation

My hope is hidden in the Lord
He flowers each promise of His word
When winter fades, I know spring will come
The Lord is my salvation

In times of waiting, times of need
When I know loss, when I am weak
I know His grace will renew these days
The Lord is my salvation

Who is like the Lord our God?
Strong to save faithful in love
My debt is paid, and the victory won
The Lord is my salvation

And when I reach my final day 
He will not leave me 
in the grave

But I will rise
He will call me home
THe Lord is my salvation

Who is like the Lord our God?
Strong to save faithful in love
My debt is paid, and the victory won
The Lord is my salvation

Glory be to God, the Father
Glory be to God, the Son
Glory be to God, the Spirit
The Lord is our Salvation

Glory be to God, the Father
Glory be to God, the Son
Glory be to God, the Spirit
The Lord is our Salvation

Who is like the Lord our God?
Strong to save faithful in love
My debt is paid, and the victory won
The Lord is my salvation

The Lord is my salvation
The Lord is my salvation
