When this life of trials
test my faith
I set my hope on Jesus

When the questions come
and doubts remain
I set my hope on Jesus

For the deepest wounds
that time won't heal
There's a joy that
runs still deeper

There's a truth that's more
than all I feel
I set my hope on Jesus

I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus

Though I falter in this
war with sin
I set my hope on Jesus

When I fail the fight 
and sink within
I set my hope on Jesus

Though the shame would 
drown me in its sea
And I dread the waves of justice

I will cast my life on Calvary
I set my hope on Jesus

I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus

Though the world called me 
to leave my Lord
I set my hope on Jesus

Though it offer all its 
vain rewards
I set my hope on Jesus

Though this heart of mine 
is prone to stray
Give me grace enough to finish

'Til I worship on that final day
I set my hope on Jesus

I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus

I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus
I set my hope on Jesus
