All of creation
All of the earth
Make straight a highway
A path for the Lord

Jesus is coming soon

Call back the sinner
Wake up the saint
Let every nation shout of Your fame

Jesus is coming soon

Like a bride waiting for her groom
We'll be at Church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing 

Even so come
Lord Jesus, come 

Even so come
Lord Jesus, come 

There will be justice
all will be new
Your name forever
faithful and true

Jesus is coming soon

Oh, like a bride waiting for her groom
We'll be at Church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing

Even so come
Lord Jesus, come 
Even so come
Lord Jesus, come 

So we wait
We wait for You
God, we wait
You're coming soon

So we wait
We wait for You
God, we wait
You're coming soon

Like a bride waiting for her groom
We'll be at Church, ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing

Like a bride waiting for her groom
We'll be at Church, we'll be ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing

Even so come
Lord Jesus, come 

Even so come
Lord Jesus, come 

Even so come
Lord Jesus, come 

Even so come
Lord Jesus, come
