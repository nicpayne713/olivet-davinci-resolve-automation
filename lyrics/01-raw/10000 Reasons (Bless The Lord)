Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

The sun comes up
It's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again

Whatever may pass 
And whatever lies before me
Let me be singing 
When the evening comes

Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

You're rich in love 
And You're slow to anger
Your name is great 
And Your heart is kind

For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons 
For my heart to find

So bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

And on that day 
When my strength is failing
The end draws near 
And my time has come

Still my soul will sing 
Your praise unending

Ten thousand years 
And then forevermore
Forevermore

Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul, worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

Yes I will worship Your holy name
Lord, I'll worship Your holy name

Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name
I will worship Your holy name
Worship Your holy name
