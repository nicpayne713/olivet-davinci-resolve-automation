When all I see is the battle
You see my victory
When all I see is the mountain 
You see a mountain moved

And as I walk through the shadow 
Your love surrounds me
There's nothing to fear now 
For I am safe with You

So when I fight
I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God 
The battle belongs to You

And every fear I Lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

And if You are for me
Who can be against me
For Jesus, there's nothing 
Impossible for You

When all I see are the ashes
You see the beauty
When all I see is a cross
God, You see the empty tomb

So when I fight
I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

Almighty fortress
You go before us
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

You shine in the shadow
You win every battle
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

An almighty fortress
You go before us
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

You shine in the shadow
You win every battle
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

An almighty fortress
You go before us
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

You shine in the shadows
You win every battle
Nothing can stand against 
The power of our God

So when I fight
I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God
The battle belongs to You

Oh God
The battle belongs to You
