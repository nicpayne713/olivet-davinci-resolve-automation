Come all you weary
Come all you thirsty
Come to the well
That never runs dry

Drink of the water
Come and thirst no more

Well, come all you sinners
Come find His mercy
Come to the table
He will satisfy

Taste of His goodness
Find what you're looking for

For God so loved
The world that He gave us
His one and only
Son to save us

Whoever believes in Him
Will live forever

Bring all your failures
Bring your addictions
Come lay them down
At the foot of the cross

Jesus is waiting there
With open arms

For God so loved
The world that He gave us
His one and only
Son to save us

Whoever believes in Him
Will live forever

The power of hell
Forever defeated
Now it is well
I'm walking in freedom

For God so loved
God so loved the world

Praise God
Praise God
From whom all blessings flow

Praise Him
Praise Him
For the wonders of His love

Praise God
Praise God
From whom all blessings flow

Praise Him
Praise Him
For the wonders of His love

His amazing love

For God so loved
The world that He gave us
His one and only
Son to save

For God so loved
The world that He gave us
His one and only
Son to save us

Whoever believes in Him
Will live forever

The power of hell
Forever defeated
Now it is well
I'm walking in freedom

For God so loved
God so loved the world

Bring all your failures
Bring your addictions
Come lay them down
At the foot of the cross

Jesus is waiting
God so loved the world
