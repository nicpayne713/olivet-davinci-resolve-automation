        I count on one thing
The same God that never fails
Will not fail me now
You won't fail me now

In the waiting
The same God who's never late
Is working all things out
You're working all things out

Yes I will
lift You high in the lowest valley
Yes I will 
bless Your name

Oh, yes I will
sing for joy 
when my heart is heavy

All my days
oh yes I will

I count on one thing
The same God that never fails
Will not fail me now
You won't fail me now

In the waiting
The same God who's never late
Is working all things out
You're working all things out

Oh, yes I will
lift You high in the lowest valley
Yes I will
bless Your name

Oh, yes I will
sing for joy
when my heart is heavy

All my days 
oh yes I will
For all my days 
oh yes, I will

And I choose to praise
To glorify, glorify
The Name of all names
That nothing can stand against

And I choose to praise
To glorify, glorify
The Name of all names
That nothing can stand against

And I choose to praise
To glorify, glorify
The Name of all names
That nothing can stand against

And I choose to praise
To glorify, to glorify
The Name of all names
That nothing can stand against

Oh, yes I will 
lift You high in the lowest valley
Yes I will
bless Your name

Oh, yes I will
sing for joy 
when my heart is heavy

All my days, oh yes, I will
For all my days, oh yes, I will
For all my days, yes, I will
