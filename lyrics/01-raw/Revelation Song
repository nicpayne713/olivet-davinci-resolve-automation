Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Holy, holy is He

Sing a new song to Him who sits on
Heaven's mercy seat

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Holy, holy is He

Sing a new song to Him who sits on
Heaven's mercy seat

Holy, holy, holy 
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come

With all creation I sing 
Praise to the King of kings
You are my everything and I will adore You

Clothed in rainbows of living color
Flashes of lightning rolls of thunder

Blessing and honor strength and 
Glory and power be
To You the only one who's King

Holy, holy, holy 
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come

With all creation I sing 
Praise to the King of kings
You are my everything and I will adore You

Filled with wonder awestruck wonder
At the mention of Your name

Jesus Your name is power    
Breath and living water
Such a marvelous mystery

Holy, holy, holy 
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and is to come

With all creation I sing 
Praise to the King of kings
You are my everything and 
I will adore You
I will adore You
