Oh Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the 
Worlds Thy hands have made

I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout 
The universe displayed

Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

And when I think that God 
Is Son not sparing
Sent Him to die
I scarce can take it in

That on the cross 
My burden gladly bearing
He bled and died 
TO take away my sin

Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then Christ shall come 
With shouts of acclamation
And lead me home what joy 
Hall fill my heart

Then I shall bow with 
Humble adoration
And then proclaim
My God how great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

How great Thou art
How great Thou art
