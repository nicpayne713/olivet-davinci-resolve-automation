Oh holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night 
Of our dear Savior's birth

Long lay the world 
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared 
And the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks 
A new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night, when Christ was born

Oh night divine
Oh nigh 
Oh night divine

Truly, He taught us 
To love one another
His law is love 
And His gospel is peace

Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cеase

Sweet hymns of joy 
In grateful chorus raise wе
Let all within us 
Praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord
Oh praise His name forever
His power and glory 
Evermore proclaim

Oh night divine
Oh night
Oh night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night, when Christ was born

Oh night divine
Oh night
Oh night divine
