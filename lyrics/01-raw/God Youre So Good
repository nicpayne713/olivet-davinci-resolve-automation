Amazing love
That welcomes me
The kindness of mercy

That bought with blood
Wholeheartedly
My soul undeserving

God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me

Behold the cross
Age to age
And hour by hour

The dead are raised
The sinner saved
The work of Your power

God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me

I am blessed, I am called
I am healed, I am whole
I am saved in Jesus' name

Highly favored, anointed
Filled with Your power
For the glory of Jesus' name

And should this life
Bring suffering
Lord, I will remember

What Calvary 
Has bought for me
Both now and forever

God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me

I am blessed, I am called
I am healed, I am whole
I am saved in Jesus' name

Highly favored, anointed
Filled with Your power
For the glory of Jesus' name

God, You're so good
God, You're so good
God, You're so good
You're so good to me
