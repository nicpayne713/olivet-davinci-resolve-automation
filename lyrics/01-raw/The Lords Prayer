Father let Your Kingdom come
Father let Your will be done
On earth as in heaven
Right here in my heart

Father let Your Kingdom come
Father let Your will be done
On earth as in heaven
Right here in my heart

Give us this day our daily bread
Forgive us, forgive us
As we forgive the ones who sinned against us
Forgive them

And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us
From the evil one
Let Your kingdom come

Father let Your Kingdom come
Father let Your will be done
On earth as in heaven
Right here in my heart

Father let Your Kingdom come
Father let Your will be done
On earth as in heaven
Right here in my heart

Give us this day our daily bread
Forgive us, forgive us
As we forgive the ones who sinned against us
Forgive them

And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from the evil one
Let Your kingdom come

It's Yours, it's Yours
All Yours, all Yours
The kingdom, the power
The glory are Yours

It's Yours, it's Yours
All Yours, all Yours
Forever and ever
The kingdom is Yours

It's Yours, it's Yours
All Yours, all Yours
The kingdom, the power
The glory are Yours

It's Yours, it's Yours
All Yours, all Yours
Forever and ever
The kingdom is Yours

Father let Your Kingdom come
Father let Your will be done
On earth as in heaven
Right here in my heart

Father let Your Kingdom come
Father let Your will be done
On earth as in heaven
Right here in my heart

On earth as in heaven
Right here in my heart
