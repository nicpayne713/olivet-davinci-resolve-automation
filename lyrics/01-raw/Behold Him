He who was before there was light
Walked across the pages of time
He who made every living thing
Behold Him

He who heard humanity's cry
Left His throne to wake as a child
He became like the least of us
Behold Him

Jesus Son of God Messiah
The Lamb the roaring Lion
Oh be still
and behold Him

He who dined with
sinners and saints
Healed the blind
the lost and the lame

Even now He is in our midst
Behold Him

He who chose a criminal's end
Paid with blood to settle our debt
Buried death as He rose to life
Behold Him

Jesus Son of God Messiah
The Lamb the roaring Lion
Oh be still
and behold Him

Jesus Alpha and Omega
Our God the risen Savior
Oh be still
and behold Him

Holy holy holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy worthy worthy
To receive all praise

Holy holy holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy worthy worthy
To receive all praise

Holy holy holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy worthy worthy
To receive all praise

Holy holy holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy worthy worthy
To receive all praise

Jesus Son of God Messiah
The Lamb the roaring Lion
Oh be still and behold Him

Jesus Alpha and Omega
Our God the risen Savior
Oh be still
and behold Him

Behold Him
