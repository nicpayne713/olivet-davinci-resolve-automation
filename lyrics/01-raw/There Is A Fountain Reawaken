There is a fountain 
Filled with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins

And sinners plunged 
Beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains

And sinners plunged 
Beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day

And there have I though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

Washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away

And there have I though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

Dear dying Lamb 
Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power

Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more

Be saved to sin no more
Be saved to sin no more

Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more

E’er since by faith 
I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply

Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die

Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die
