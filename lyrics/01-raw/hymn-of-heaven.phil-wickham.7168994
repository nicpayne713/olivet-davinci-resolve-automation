        How I long 
to breathe the air of Heaven
Where pain is gone 
and mercy fills the streets

To look upon 
the one who bled to save me
And walk with Him 
for all eternity

There will be a day
When all will bow before Him
There will be a day
When death will be no more

Standing face to face
With He who died and rose again
Holy 
Holy is the Lord

Every prayer 
We prayed in desperation
The songs of faith
We sang through doubt and fear

In the end 
We'll see that it was worth it
When He returns 
to wipe away our tears

There will be a day
When all will bow before Him
There will be a day
When death will be no more

Standing face to face
With He who died and rose again
Holy 
Holy is the Lord

On that day 
we join the resurrection
And stand beside 
the heroes of the faith

With one voice 
a thousand generations
Sing worthy is 
the Lamb who was slain

On that day 
We join the resurrection
And stand beside 
the heroes of the faith

With one voice 
a thousand generations
Sing worthy is 
the Lamb who was slain
Forever He shall reign

So let it be today
We shout the hymn of Heaven
With angels and the Saints
We raise a mighty roar

Glory to our God
Who gave us life beyond the grave
Holy holy is the Lord

So let it be today
We shout the hymn of Heaven
With angels and the Saints
We raise a mighty roar

Glory to our God
Who gave us life beyond the grave
Holy 
Holy is the Lord

Holy 
Holy is the Lord

Holy 
Holy is the Lord
