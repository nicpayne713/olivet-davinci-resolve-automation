        My Jesus, I love Thee
I know Thou art mine

For Thee all the follies 
of sin I resign

My gracious Redeemer
my Savior art Thou
If ever I loved Thee
my Jesus, 'tis now

I love Thee because 
Thou hast first loved me

And purchased my pardon 
on Calvary's tree

I love Thee for wearing 
the thorns on Thy brow
If ever I loved Thee
my Jesus, 'tis now

I'll love Thee in life 
and I will love Thee in death

And praise Thee as long 
as Thou lendest me breath

And say when the death 
dew lies cold on my brow

If ever I loved Thee
my Jesus, 'tis now

Right now
Right now
Redeemer
My Savior
Oh-whoa

'Tis now
Right now
Today's the day
Oh You would love me first

Let the amen sound from his people again
Gladly forever adore him
