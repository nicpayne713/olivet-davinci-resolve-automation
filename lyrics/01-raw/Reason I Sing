You brought me from darkness
And clothed me in garments of praise
Jesus, forever
My song will be You

I'm living in freedom
You've taken my burdens away
Jesus, forever
My song will be You

Only for You

For the cross that You bore 
And the debt that You paid
For the victory 
You won over death and the grave

This is the reason I sing

For the hope that You give 
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that 
Heaven is waiting for me

This is the reason I sing

I will not be silent
I'll testify of Your grace
Jesus, forever
My song will be You

Only for You

For the cross that You bore 
And the debt that You paid
For the victory 
You won over death and the grave
This is the reason I sing

For the hope that You give 
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that 
Heaven is waiting for me

This is the reason I sing

So good so good
You're so good to me

Forever 
I'll sing
You're so good to me

So good so good
You're so good to me

Forever I'll sing
You're so good to me

For the cross that You bore 
And the debt that You paid
For the victory 
You won over death and the grave

Oh, this is the reason I sing

For the hope that You give 
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that 
Heaven is waiting for me

This is the reason I sing

For the cross that You bore 
And the debt that You paid
For the victory 
You won over death and the grave

This is the reason I sing

For the hope that You give 
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that 
Heaven is waiting for me

Oh, this is the reason I sing

Jesus, the reason I sing
Jesus, the reason I sing
Jesus, the reason I sing
