Mine are days that 
God has numbered
I was made to 
walk with Him

Yet I look for 
worldly treasure
And forsake the 
King of kings

But mine is hope 
in my Redeemer
Though I fall
His love is sure

For Christ has paid 
for every failing
I am His forevermore

Mine are tears in 
times of sorrow
Darkness not 
yet understood

Through the valley 
I must travel
Where I see no 
earthly good

But mine is peace 
that flows from Heaven
And the strength 
in times of need

I know my pain 
will not be wasted
Christ completes 
his work in me

Mine are days here 
as a stranger
Pilgrim on a 
narrow way

One with Christ 
I will encounter
Harm and hatred 
for His name

But mine is armour 
for this battle
Strong enough 
to last the war

And He has said 
He will deliver
Safely to the 
golden shore

And mine are keys 
to Zion city
Where beside 
the King I walk

For there my heart 
has found its treasure
Christ is mine forevermore

Come rejoice now
O my soul
For His love 
is my reward

Fear is gone and 
hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

Come rejoice now
O my soul
For His love 
is my reward

Fear is gone and 
hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

Come rejoice now
O my soul
For His love is my reward

Fear is gone and 
hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

And mine are keys 
to Zion city
Where beside the King I walk
For there my heart has 
found its treasure

Christ is mine forevermore
Christ is mine forevermore
Christ is mine forevermore
