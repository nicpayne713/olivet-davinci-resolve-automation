What gift of grace 
Is Jesus my redeemer
There is no more 
For heaven now to give

He is my joy
My righteousness, and freedom
My steadfast love
My deep and boundless peace

To this I hold
My hope is only Jesus
For my life is wholly bound to His

Oh how strange and divine
I can sing, "All is mine"
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

The night is dark 
But I am not forsaken
For by my side
The Saviour He will stay

I labour on 
In weakness and rejoicing
For in my need
His power is displayed

To this I hold
My Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley 
He will lead

Oh the night has been won
And I shall overcome
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

No fate I dread
I know I am forgiven
The future sure 
The price it has been paid

For Jesus bled 
And suffered for my pardon
And He was raised 
To overthrow the grave

To this I hold
My sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea

Oh the chains are released
I can sing, "I am free"
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

With every breath 
I long to follow Jesus
For He has said 
That He will bring me home

And day by day 
I know He will renew me
Until I stand 
With joy before the throne

To this I hold
My hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him

When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

To this I hold
My hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him

When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

Yet not I, but through Christ in me
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
