Go on up to the mountain of mercy
To the crimson perpetual tide

Kneel down on the shore
be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified

Follow Christ to the holy mountain
Sinner sorry and wrecked 
by the fall

Cleanse your heart and soul 
in the fountain that flows
For you for me and for all

At the wonderful tragic 
mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous 
night you and me

Were atoned by His blood 
and forever washed white
On a beautiful scandalous night

On the hillside 
you will be delivered
At the foot of the cross justified

And your spirit restored 
by the river that pours
From our blessed Savior's side

At the wonderful tragic 
mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous 
night you and me

Were atoned by His blood 
and forever washed white
On a beautiful scandalous night

At the wonderful tragic 
mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous 
night you and me

Were atoned by His blood 
and forever washed white
On a beautiful scandalous night

Yeah yeah oh oh

Go on up to the mountain of mercy
To the crimson perpetual tide

Kneel down on the shore 
be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified

At the wonderful tragic 
mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous 
night you and me

Were atoned by His blood 
and forever washed white
On a beautiful scandalous night

On a beautiful scandalous night
On a beautiful scandalous night
