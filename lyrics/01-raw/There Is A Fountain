There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in His day
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

Washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its pow'r
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more

Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more

E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

When this poor, lisping, 
stamm'ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave
Then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save

I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
Then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
